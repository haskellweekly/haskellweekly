Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [How to prevent GHC from inferring types with undesirable constraints](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-07-20-ill-formedness-indicators/) by Nicolas Frisby
  > For a broad class of domain-specific constraints/languages, this is the first technique I've learned of that enables custom compile-time error messages in the particularly insidious scenario where the user's mistake incurs polymorphism that the library author did not intend.

- [Lazy Layout](https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2023-07-22-lazy-layout.html) by Jasper Van der Jeugt
  > Tumblr in particular has a fairly nice way to do photo sets, where these can be organised in rows and columns. I wanted to see if I could mimic this in a recursive way, where rows and columns can be subdivided further.

## In brief

- [GHC Steering Committee seeks input from industrial Haskell users](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-steering-committee-seeks-input-from-industrial-haskell-users/7096?u=taylorfausak) by David Christiansen
  > The Haskell Foundation's Stability Working Group thinks that this can solve a real need: teams of Haskell developers will be able to more easily understand the status of extensions and express machine-checked policies for CI.

## Show & tell

- [IHP version 1.1.0](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v1.1.0) by Marc Scholten
  > This release brings some large improvements to the dev environment by integrating devenv.sh, adds native GPT4 support through ihp-openai and much more.
