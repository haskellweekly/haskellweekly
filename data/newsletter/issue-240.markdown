Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Issue #1](https://bindthegap.news/#issues) by Bind the Gap
  > Featuring Simon Peyton Jones about Haskell Foundation, Alexander Granin's "Functional Architecture and Design" book, ImpurePics exclusive content, aeson library review, and much more!

- [Complicated Haskell Words - Isomorphism](https://juliu.is/complicated-haskell-words-isomorphism/) by Ju Liu
  > My goal here is to explain these terms using the simplest analogies I've come across.

- [Composition in Trick-Taking Card Games](https://3fx.ch/blog/2020/12/03/composition-in-trick-taking-card-games/) by Ben Fiedler
  > In this blog post we dive a bit deeper into the implementation of determining trick winners, and discover a neat application of composition to solve this problem.

- [Error handling is hard](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/error-handling-is-hard/) by Michael Snoyman
  > We like to think of it as a trivial but tedious task. It isn't. Doing this correctly requires real thought and design.

- [Haskell, Nix and using packages from GitHub](https://magnus.therning.org/posts/2020-11-30-1734-haskell__nix_and_using_packages_from_github.html) by Magnus Therning
  > Now I only had to verify if that was the case by using the most recent, and unreleased code on the `develop` branch of Amazonka.

- [The Haskell runtime is what sets it apart from the competition](https://harporoeder.com/posts/haskell-runtime/) by Harpo Roeder
  > Here I explore some of the lesser talked about features that greatly contribute to the Haskells power, performance, and convenience.

- [How would I do it in Haskell?](https://odone.io/posts/2020-11-26-how-would-i-do-it-in-haskell.html) by Riccardo Odone
  > Since I started playing with functional programming, not only I've dot-chained the hell out of object-oriented code, but I often catch myself thinking: how would I do this in Haskell?

- [Is Haskell fast?](https://arifordsham.com/is-haskell-fast/) by Ari Fordsham
  > If you try to research this question, you might come up with confusing and contradictory answers, strongly-stated opinions, and loads of technical jargon.

- [My journey into Haskell](https://gustavofranke.github.io/posts/2020-12-01-my-journey-into-haskell.html) by Gustavo Franke
  > I try to have more than one project on the go at a time, so I can switch back and forth, think a little more about things, and then come back after a while.

## In brief

- [Advent of Haskell 2020](https://adventofhaskell.com) by Antei & Konfy
  > Each day we are going to unwrap something new, people of the community are going to share a present with you.

- [A content addressable store for Nix with Théophane Hufschmitt](https://www.compositional.fm/content-addressable-nix-1) by Compositional
  > In this episode, Rok Garbas interviews Théophane Hufschmitt who is implementing a content addressed storage for Nix.

- [Executing Executables!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/11/30/executing-executables) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > So in addition to testing whether or not our exercises compile, we'll also want to run the code the user wrote and see if it works properly!

- [The Haskell Foundation](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/12/haskell-foundation) by Michael Snoyman
  > This post is not about past mistakes and regrets, though I have both. It's about forging a path forward.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (December 2020)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/k3zxqy/monthly_hask_anything_december_2020/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

## Show & tell

- [servant-exceptions 0.2.1](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/k1atkc/ann_servantexceptions_021/) by Sebastian Nagel
  > After two years of not doing it, I finally updated and released a new version, compatible with current servant versions and with some more documentation.
