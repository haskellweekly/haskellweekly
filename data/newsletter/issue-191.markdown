Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Random benchmarks](https://alexey.kuleshevi.ch/blog/2019/12/21/random-benchmarks/) by Alexey Kuleshevich
  > This post will compare performance of available libraries in Haskell for random number generation, as well as provide a brief introduction on how to use those libraries and what their conceptual differences are.

- [Monadic Party 2020](https://monadic.party) by Monadic Party
  > Monadic Party is a four days long summer school of Haskell with excellent speakers, three tracks and lunch included. Join us this year for workshops at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. See the recordings from our previous two editions on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeiYYR2fCXarkfSqqFBwuA/videos). CFP applications are open.

- [Haskell art in your browser with Asterius](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-12-19-asterius-diagrams.html) by Sylvain Henry & Shao Cheng
  > Asterius has reached a new milestone: it can now compile the popular diagrams library for drawing with Haskell.

- [Making a small Haskell application](https://functional.christmas/2019/23) by Morten Kolstad
  > To try to help to bridge this gap, I will walk through how to create a "practical" Haskell application.

- [Async Exceptions in Haskell, and Rust](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/async-exceptions-haskell-rust) by Michael Snoyman
  > This post is going to compare the Haskell async exception mechanism to whatever powers Tokio's `timeout`.

- [A Glossary of Functional Programming](http://degoes.net/articles/fp-glossary) by John A. De Goes
  > Over time, I’ve collected and converged on simple (but reasonably precise) pedagogical definitions for a range of functional concepts.

- [Up to date Real World Haskell](https://github.com/tssm/up-to-date-real-world-haskell) by Tae Sandoval
  > Sadly the language and libraries have changed enough to make several of the examples useless so I am making them working again.

- [Parsers And Builders As Prisms](https://yairchu.github.io/posts/codecs-as-prisms.html) by Yair Chuchem
  > In this post we'll introduce Construct's declarative approach and then discuss how to implement an equivalent principled solution in Haskell, based on optics.

- [Faster Database Testing with the New `tmp-postgres`](https://jfischoff.github.io/blog/faster-database-testing.html) by Jonathan Fischoff
  > The new `tmp-postgres` is over 5x faster on macOS and linux but the story doesn’t end here.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [FIR](https://gitlab.com/sheaf/fir/blob/cbbfb3b6a8731ac10f4d90e42ece705abe4e0656/readme.md), an EDSL that compiles to SPIR-V for graphics programming on the GPU in Haskell.
