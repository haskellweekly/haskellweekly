Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Compiling to Intrinsically Typed Combinators](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2023/07/13/compiling-to-intrinsically-typed-combinators/) by Brent Yorgey
  > How to compile a functional language via combinators (and evaluate via the Haskell runtime) while keeping the entire process type-indexed, with a bibliography and lots of references for further reading.

- [Haskell and Hacking: Reflections on the GHC Contributors' Workshop and ZuriHac](https://galois.com/blog/2023/07/haskell-and-hacking-reflections-on-the-ghc-contributors-workshop-and-zurihac/) by Ryan Scott
  > Now that I have returned from the workshop, I'll use this blog post to recall my experiences and reflect on how the workshop went.

## In brief

- [Episode 147: Gabriella Gonzalez discusses the intersection of algebra and programming](https://elucidations.vercel.app/posts/episode-147/) by Elucidations Podcast
  > In this episode, Matt talks to Gabriella Gonzalez about how basic concepts from the branch of math known as abstract algebra can help us simplify our computer programs and organize our thoughts.

- [Episode 30: Bartosz Milewski](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/30/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Bartosz shares his thoughts on the "fringe topics" in programming, from C++ templates to category theory in Haskell. How he considers monads to be like fingers sticking out of the water. And he'll talk a little bit about his upcoming book and his thoughts on linear types.

- [IOG GHC Update #14](https://engineering.iog.io/2023-07-13-ghc-update/) by IOG
  > Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

- [Quotient Haskell: Lightweight Quotient Types for All](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/paper-quotient-haskell-lightweight-quotient-types-for-all/7013?u=taylorfausak) by Heneli Kailahi
  > A key difficulty to wider adoption of quotient types lies in the significant burden of proof-obligations that arises from their use. In this article, we address this issue by introducing a class of quotient types for which the proof-obligations are decidable by an SMT solver.

- [Your Moderators](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14zeyv4/your_moderators/) by David Christiansen
  > After deliberation and discussion, we're pleased to announce that the new moderation team for this subreddit.

  > We have been working to get GHCup up to speed wrt cross compilers and GHC JS backend. This is still experimental, which is why it's a pre-release, so we can gather some user experience reports.

- [Haskelite](https://github.com/pbv/haskelite/tree/965e509626f55f0bc6477627883c27d5e1fcd100) by Pedro Baltazar Vasconcelos
