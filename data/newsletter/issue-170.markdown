Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Client-side web programming in Haskell: A retrospective](https://chrisdone.com/posts/clientside-programming-haskell/) by Chris Done

    > At the beginning of this decade, a few of us Haskellers were exploring how best to do client-side web programming. We didn't want to write JavaScript.

-   [Generating castles for Minecraft using Haskell](http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/posts/2019-07-25-minecraft.html) by Tim Philip Williams

    > My kids and I have enjoyed building various structures in the game Minecraft, but it can get rather monotonous placing blocks one-at-a-time.

-   [Introducing the Haskell Phrasebook](https://typeclasses.com/news/2019-07-phrasebook) by Type Classes

    > We are excited to announce The Haskell Phrasebook. Taking an approach similar to Go by Example, it emphasizes how to get started writing programs quickly.

-   [Practical event driven & sourced programs in Haskell](https://www.ahri.net/2019/07/practical-event-driven-and-sourced-programs-in-haskell/) by Adam Piper

    > I'm going to provide a quick overview of the technique of driving a system through events, and what sourcing those events means in this context, and then show some code.

-   [Right fold superpowers!](https://hmemcpy.com/2019/07/right-fold-superpowers/) by Igal Tabachnik

    > It's amazing how sometimes just having a different framing of the problem helps with developing a much deeper understanding of the problem.

-   [Solving a puzzle in Haskell](https://medium.com/@cdsmithus/solving-a-puzzle-in-haskell-8216a683555) by Chris Smith

    > At some point, I unfolded it and attempted it myself. It was not a success! So now I had an unfolded puzzle on my desk.

-   [Student Blog: Testing Bipartiteness with Monad Transformers](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2019-07-26-testing-bipartiteness.html) by Vasily Alferov

    > I'm here to tell you about my implementation of the algorithm for testing bipartiteness of graphs.  A graph is called bipartite if its vertices can be split into two parts in such way that there are no edges inside one part.

-   [The Power of RecordWildCards](https://kodimensional.dev/recordwildcards) by Dmitrii Kovanikov

    > RecordWildCards is one of the language extensions that improve the situation with records. However, it's one of the most controversial extensions at the same time.

-   [Writing efficient free variable traversals](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20190728-free-variable-traversals.html) by Ben Gamari

    > GHC's free variable traversals are some of the most heavily used pieces of code in the compiler and we try hard to ensure that they are efficient.

## Jobs
