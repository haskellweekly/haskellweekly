    > I was enjoying writing Haskell till the time I was dealing with JSONs and talking to the Telegram API. But as soon as I wanted to deal with the database, write HTML templates, or process forms, I was hitting a lot of friction.

    > The excellent new benefit of the `IsLabel` class is that you can look at the type-level string and return a value dependent on that type.

    > There are good reasons why people like to use scripting languages. This blog post is going to demonstrate doing some non-trivial work with Haskell, and do so with a fully reproducible and trivially installed toolchain, supported on multiple operating systems.

-   [Happy 10th birthday pandoc!](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pandoc-discuss/0rutNJAVKoc/EeQDFT2lCQAJ)

    > One might wonder whether it matters that pandoc is written in Haskell. Certainly it would have been possible to write a program that does what pandoc does in any language. But the security provided by Haskell's type system has kept me sane when I have needed to make major changes or do large-scale refactoring.
