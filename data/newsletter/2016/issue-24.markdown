-   [Try Backpack: `ghc --backpack`](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/10/try-backpack-ghc-backpack/)

    > Backpack, a new system for mix-in packages in Haskell, has landed in GHC HEAD. This means that it has become a lot easier to try Backpack out: you just need a nightly build of GHC.

    > In its fifth year, the Haskell eXchange is an annual conference created for and by the Skills Matter community. An opportunity for Haskellers to meet, learn and share skills, discover emerging technologies and help evolve the Haskell ecosystem.

-   [Thoughts on Haskell](http://get-finch.com/2016/09/26/thoughts_on_haskell.html)

    > After spending most of a year doing Elm I have now been doing Haskell for a few weeks. I wanted to share my first impressions after about a month of Haskell. I have to say that compared to Elm I have been rather frustrated. I think the experience for new users in Haskell involves a much steeper learning curve than is needed.

    > Data science should be data driven with a strong focus on types. Our aim is to bring powerful tools to the best language for this task: Haskell.

-   [Static compilation with Stack](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/10/static-compilation-with-stack)

    > If we were to compile pid1 completely static it could be portable (within a given range of Linux kernel versions). Let's explore different ways to compile a GHC executable with Stack. Maybe we can come up with a way to create portable binaries.

-   [Descriptive variable names: A code smell?](http://degoes.net/articles/insufficiently-polymorphic)

    > If you can name your variables after more descriptive things than `f`, `a`, `b`, and so on, then your code is probably monomorphic. Monomorphic code is much more likely to be incorrect than polymorphic code, because for every type signature, there are many more possible implementations.
