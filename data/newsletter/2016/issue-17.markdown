-   [Mustache templates in Haskell](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/mustache-templates/)

    > Mustache templates are popular logic-less templates that can be used in web development as well as in any other domain where interpolation of data into some sort of template is needed.

    > Using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can use Electron to develop a desktop application. The nice part about Movie Monad, however, is that we will create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Haskell.

-   [Lens and Linear: 2048's logic in 22 lines](https://www.nmattia.com/posts/2016-08-19-lens-linear-2048.html)

    > It is actually a problem that can be solved elegantly in Haskell using a few Isos and Traversals. We'll use the linear library for representing the data and the lens library for accessing it.

-   [TechEmpower Benchmarks](https://turingjump.com/blog/tech-empower/)

    > Rather than wait for the official results, I ran the benchmarks with a handful of frameworks on a dedicated server. The results are, I think, enough to put these concerns to rest.

    > dbrecord-opaleye is a haskell library that automatically takes care of changing the shape of your model depending on the operation (projection, aggregation, left join).

-   [Bookkeeper](https://turingjump.com/blog/bookkeeper/)

    > If we keep all of the field-to-type mappings at the type-level representation of a datatype, we can use that to not have to write IsLabel instances manually. As an added bonus, we'll get anonymous records!

-   [Pitfalls in Haskell](http://users.jyu.fi/~sapekiis/haskell-pitfalls/)

    > This text demonstrates the difficulties people often face when learning Haskell. It is perhaps biased by my own experiences, so it may emphasize things that C and Scheme have taught me. Those would be paranoia and flexibility.
