-   [Showcasing Applicative](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/710-Showcasing_Applicative)

    > My plan for this week's lecture of the CIS 194 Haskell course at the University of Pennsylvania is to dwell a bit on the concept of Functor, Applicative and Monad, and to highlight the value of the Applicative abstraction.

-   [Grokking fix](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2016/10/26/grokking_fix.html)

    > Haskell's laziness enables some pretty cool tricks. The `fix` function is one of the neater ones, though it can be hard to understand how to use it from just the implementation and type signature. A fixed point of a function is some value where applying the function to the value returns the same value.

    > A keynote talk at MuniHac 2016 given by Gabriella Gonzalez. This talk covers an analytics trick that commonly arises in distributed/parallel programming. Haskell permits an elegant, efficient, and general implementation of this trick which also has useful applications outside of high-performance computing.

    > I recently solved a problem (using Haskell) that ended up being tougher than I thought, but I learned a lot along the way. Rather than just presenting a solution, I'd like to take you through my thought process, crazy detours and all.
