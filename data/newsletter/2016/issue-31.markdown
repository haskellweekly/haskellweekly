    > The GHC team is happy to (finally!) announce the first candiate of the 8.0.2 release of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. This is the first of what will hopefully be only two release candidates leading up the final 8.0.2 release.

-   [GHC optimization and fusion](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/ghc-optimization-and-fusion/)

    > The tutorial walks through the details of using GHC pragmas such as `INLINE`, `SPECIALIZE`, and `RULES` to improve the performance of your Haskell programs. This tutorial is an attempt to show all important optimization "know-how" details in one place with practical examples benchmarked to demonstrate their effects.

-   [Latest additions to Megaparsec](https://mrkkrp.github.io/posts/latest-additions-to-megaparsec.html)

    > I think it's time for a little blog post summarizing progress of the Megaparsec project in the second half of 2016. There are quite a few new things I have never announced and I fear that from the changelog alone it isn't obvious how useful they are.

-   [Haskell documentation, 2016 update](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2016/11/haskell-documentation-2016-update)

    > I've blogged, Tweeted, and conversed about Haskell documentation quite a bit in the past. Following up on tooling issues, all available evidence tells me that improving the situation for documentation in Haskell is the next obstacle we need to knock down.
