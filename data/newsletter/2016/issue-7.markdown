-   [The Story of Haskell at IMVU](https://chadaustin.me/2016/06/the-story-of-haskell-at-imvu/)

    > One weekend, Andy went home with the explicit goal of proving that Haskell was stupid and not good for writing production software. He came back on Monday glowing.

-   [Four months with Haskell](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/06/12/four-months-with-haskell/)

    > I certainly wasn't prepared for some of the areas where Haskell would blow me away, nor was I capable of realizing which parts would leave me hopelessly frustrated.

-   [Distributed Systems in Haskell](https://yager.io/Distributed/Distributed.html)

    > As with many things Haskell, there's a somewhat higher upfront cost, but it makes your life a lot easier as your programs scale up.

-   [Behavior-driven development (BDD) in Haskell with Hspec](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/bdd-in-haskell-with-hspec/)

    > When programming the BDD way, you start writing the specs first. This is not only a good practice, it also helps to reason about your code as a series of individual decoupled units.

-   [Rapid: GHCi background threads, hot reloading and reload-surviving values](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/rapid-0.1.1/docs/Rapid.html)

    > You can use it for background services within a GHCi session that survive loading, reloading and unloading modules, which is particularly useful when writing long-running programs like servers and user interfaces.

    > Haskell has a reputation for being a safe language. One that generally speaking pushes more of the possible programming errors to compile-time errors.

-   [Does Haskell have "variables"? Or, easiest way to read configuration data?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37770984/does-haskell-have-variables-or-easiest-way-to-read-configuration-data)

    > Haskell has immutable values, which is understood and appreciated. Does it even have immutable variable binding?
