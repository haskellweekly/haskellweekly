Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Episode 28: GHC 2021](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/28.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Does the idea of -XGHC2021 excite you? Cameron Gera and Taylor Fausak work through this proposed set of language extensions.

- [Quicksort in Haskell](https://qnikst.github.io/posts/2020-10-18-quicksort.html) by Alexander Vershilov
  > Making beautiful quicksort real with rewriting rules.

- [Cellular Automaton in Haskell (II). WireWorld](https://herebeseaswines.net/essays/2020-10-23-wireworld) by Claes-Magnus Berg
  > When making WireWorld we can reuse large parts (with some trivial changes) of the UI made for the implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

- [Accidentally-Quadratic HashMaps](http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2020/10/16/accidentally-quadratic_hashmaps/index.html) by Jack Kelly
  > Unless you're careful, using `foldMap` to build `HashMap`s can take O(n^2) time.

- [Handling of Uncaught Exceptions in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/uncaught-exception-handling) by Ivan Gromakovsky
  > When your Haskell application's thread throws an exception that does not get caught, the Haskell runtime system will handle it and print it based on the `Show` instance.

- [Haskell: The Bad Parts, part 1](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1) by Michael Snoyman
  > Haskell is a great language with some warts. Ideally, we'd get rid of the warts. Second to that: let's be honest about the warts and warn people away from them.

- [Plucking In, Plucking Out](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2020/10/27/plucking_in_plucking_out.html) by Matt Parsons
  > In The Trouble With Typed Errors, I argue that an error type that is too big is a major problem. But I've never really been bothered with an `env` type that is too big. Why is that?

- [Tagged is not a Newtype](https://tech.freckle.com/2020/10/26/tagged-is-not-a-newtype/) by Evan Borden
  > As learners get deeper into the ecosystem, as they explore more GHC extensions, they find `Tagged` and `DataKinds`.
