Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Lessons learned from writing ShellCheck, GitHub's now most starred Haskell project](https://www.vidarholen.net/contents/blog/?p=859) by Vidar Holen
  > I started the project 8 years ago, and this seems like a good opportunity to share some of the lessons learned along the way.

- [Decimal Safety Right on The Money](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/safe-decimal-right-on-the-money) by Alexey Kuleshevich
  > I would like to share an approach for safely and efficiently representing currency data in Haskell with safe-decimal.

- [Upcoming stackage LTS 15 snapshot with ghc-8.8.2](https://www.stackage.org/blog/2020/02/upcoming-lts-15-ghc-8-8-2) by Mihai Maruseac
  > The stackage curator team has started preparations for an LTS major bump which will include ghc-8.8.2.

- [Safe memory management in inline-java using linear types](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2020-02-06-safe-inline-java.html) by Facundo Dominguez
  > In this post I aim to walk you through the upcoming safe interface of the library, which allows detecting memory management mistakes at compile time using linear types.

- [Haskell in Production: Riskbook](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-industry-riskbook) by Gints Dreimanis
  > To continue our series on Haskell in production, we have an interview with Jezen Thomas, the CTO of Riskbook.

- [Compiling Haskell to JavaScript, not in the way you'd expect](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2020-02-09-compiling-haskell-to-javascript.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > Compiling Haskell to JavaScript in this way won't work for all of Haskell, for example type-classes are not resolved, not to mention lazy vs. strict semantics.

- [Competitive Programming in Haskell: primes and factoring](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2020/02/07/competitive-programming-in-haskell-primes-and-factoring/) by Brent Yorgey
  > I've developed a bunch of code over the years that regularly comes in handy.

- [Converting Cabal to Nix!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/2/10/converting-cabal-to-nix) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > A neat tool allows us to get the advantages of Nix in conjunction with Cabal. This week, we'll explore how to make a basic project with this combination.

- [HUnit vs. QuickCheck](https://twonki.github.io/HUnit-vs-QuickCheck/) by Leonhard Applis
  > Seeing tests go green fills my heart with joy, and thinking up tests feels for me like a kid who build a lego-castle and now plays with figures in it.

- [Announce: Color library](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ezl9e2/ann_color_library/) by Alexey Kuleshevich
  > I would like to announce a library named Color, which is designed for performing arbitrary color space conversion, chromatic adaptation and any other color manipulations.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## In brief

- [Announcing generic-optics (& generic-lens 2.0.0.0)](https://kcsongor.github.io/generic-lens-2/) by Csongor Kiss
  > generic-optics is essentially a port of generic-lens that is compatible with optics, and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for generic-lens.

- [arduino-copilot combinators](https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/arduino-copilot_combinators/) by Joey Hess
  > It's feeling like I'm laying the keystone on this project. It's all about the combinators now.

- [Dhall Survey Results (2019-2020)](http://www.haskellforall.com/2020/02/dhall-survey-results-2019-2020.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > The main thing I concluded from the survey feedback is that people want us to focus on ease of integration, especially language bindings, and especially Python language bindings.

- [Farewell](https://blog.qfpl.io/posts/farewell/index.html) by Dave Laing
  > The three year partnership with the Queensland Government as part of its Advance Queensland Initiative is now coming to a close.
