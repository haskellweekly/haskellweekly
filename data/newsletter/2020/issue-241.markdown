Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Developer Economics Survey](https://www.developereconomics.net/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=haskell&utm_campaign=haskell_newsletter) (ad)
  > It's our 20th survey anniversary! Discover new questions, prizes, and surprise perks.

- [Advent of Haskell](https://github.com/bolt12/advent-of-haskell-dd/blob/0fb44c6b101545f5fb7421a9a4983a8fb7d4bf28/README.md) by Armando Santos
  > Denotational Design, developed by Conal Elliott, is an abstract and rigorous design method, that forces the programmer to really understand the nature of his problem domain, stepping back and design the meaning of abstraction before implementing it.

- [Building a Bulletin Board Using Scotty and Friends](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2020/12/05/scotty-bulletin-board) by Gil Mizrahi
  > It'll be so simple that we won't even use a database, but hopefully it'll provide enough information on scotty that you can continue it yourselves if you'd like.

- [Capturing the magic of Prelude.interact](https://gelisam.blogspot.com/2020/12/capturing-magic-of-preludeinteract.html) by Samuel Gélineau
  > The purpose of this post is to encourage you to consider the pure framework style more often.

- [Haskell documentation with Haddock: Wishes'n'tips](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haddock-tips) by Veronika Romashkina & Dmitrii Kovanikov
  > The blog post is going to give Haddock overview, suggest documentation best practices, reveal the specialities of the Haddock tool, and show-and-tell lots of different examples of how to squeeze more out of your documentation.

- [Haskell: The Bad Parts, part 3](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/12/haskell-bad-parts-3) by Michael Snoyman
  > Note that this is the last blog post in this series where I had specific ideas queued up. So it's likely that this will be the last post for a while until I get annoyed by something again.

- [Parser Combinators: a Walkthrough](https://hasura.io/blog/parser-combinators-walkthrough/) by Antoine Leblanc
  > Today, I want to explore Parsec, and most specifically how Parsec works. Parsing is ubiquitous, and most Haskell programs will use Parsec or one of its variants.

- [Processing CodeBlocks in Hakyll](https://blind.guru/blog/2020-12-05-codeblock.html) by Mario Lang
  > In this article, we will cover Pandoc as it is used in the Hakyll static site generator.

- [Santa's Little Lua Scripts](https://hslua.github.io/santas-little-lua-scripts.html) by Albert Krewinkel
  > Santa would just need to expose the relevant parts of the Haskell system, so the Elves could access and script it as their hearts desired.

- [The shrinks applicative](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-03-shrinks-applicative/) by Arnaud Spiwack
  > The shrinker turns the output of a failed property test from "your function has a bug" to "here is a small actionable example where your function fails to meet the specification".

- [Whirlwind Tour Of Stack For Beginners](https://schooloffp.co/2020/12/05/whirlwind-tour-of-stack-for-beginners.html) by School of FP
  > In this post, we will take a look at `stack`. It is the 3rd in a series of posts about getting started with Haskell.

## Jobs

- [Executive Directory of the Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation/ed-job-description/)
  > HF seeks a full-time Executive Director (ED) to lead and develop the organization going forward. The ED is responsible for furthering the HF’s mission and vision, ensuring that resources are in place to accomplish its goals.

## In brief

- [Adding Hints](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/12/7/adding-hints) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In this week's video, we'll see how to add "hints" to the Watcher. This way, a user can get a little extra help when they need it!

- [DAML: A Haskell-Based Language for Blockchain](https://serokell.io/blog/daml-interview) by Gints Dreimanis
  > In the interview, we talk about DAML, the benefits and downsides of functional programming languages, and their practical experience while building DAML.

- [Exaggerating the negatives](https://typeclasses.com/news/2020-12-exaggerating-the-negatives) by Chris Martin
  > Cussing is not the problem; hyperbolic non-communication is the problem. Grievances or laments about the "garbage fire" are heavy. Not light

- [The Halting Problem (Part 1)](https://boarders.github.io/posts/halting1.html) by Callan McGill
  > We will first prove halting for the lambda calculus and then see how the same argument looks when transplanted to Haskell.

- [Knowledge-as-Code](https://carboncloud.com/2020/12/07/tech-knowledge-as-code/) by Mikael Tönnberg
  > When programming, we want to capture knowledge in a way understandable for both the computer and humans, now and in the future.
