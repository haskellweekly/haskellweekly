Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 8.10.2 released](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20200808-ghc-8.10.2-released.html) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC team is happy to announce the availability of GHC 8.10.2.

- [Cross wolf, goat and cabbage across the river with effects](https://iokasimov.github.io/posts/2020/08/wgc-effects) by Murat Kasimov
  > In this blogpost we will try to find generalized solution for such puzzles with algebraic effects.

- [Definitional lawfulness: proof by inspection testing](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2020-08-08-definitional-lawfulness.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > Can we prove Monad instances lawful using `inspection-testing`?

- [Dressing Up Haskell](https://github.com/serras/hinc/blob/2fb17e217df4aeb7d8c6606be956969e0baa03a7/why.md) by Alejandro Serrano
  > Hence this experiment: Haskell In New Clothes (`hinc` for short); reimagining Haskell with a syntax inspired in modern JavaScript (or should I say ECMAScript?).

- [Functional Dependencies](https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell/tutorial/fundeps/) by Michael Snoyman
  > Functional dependencies (aka fundeps) are a language extension. It builds on top of multi param type classes, and provides the basis for many common libraries.

- [Generic Haskell](https://jmtd.net/log/generic_haskell/) by Jonathan Dowland
  > When I did the work described earlier in template haskell, I also explored generic programming in Haskell to solve a particular problem.

- [GHC activities report: June--July 2020](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2020/08/ghc-2020-06-2020-07/) by Well-Typed
  > Starting immediately, we will try to provide monthly updates on the work we have been doing. In this first edition, we will cover roughly two months, June and July 2020.

- [Hamler 0.2 - OTP Behaviours with Type Classes](https://www.emqx.io/news/hamler-0-2-otp-behaviours-with-type-classes) by EMQ
  > We are proud to announce that Hamler 0.2 has been released. Hamler is a strongly-typed functional programming language running on Erlang VM.

- [A Quick Review Of A Pure Functional Serverless Application Deployed To Production](https://susanpotter.net/software/a-quick-review-of-a-pure-functional-serverless-application-deployed-to-production/) by Susan Potter
  > Last week I deployed my second "serverless app" to production. Being fairly new to deploying serverless applications at scale I was concerned about the costs.

- [Read You A Blaze](https://devanla.com/posts/read-you-a-blaze.html) by Guru Devanla
  > In this series we will learn to create a toy version blaze-html library. After reading this article, the reader should be able to easily read through the blaze-markup and blaze-html libraries.

- [Revisiting application structure](https://felixmulder.com/writing/2020/08/08/Revisiting-application-structure.html) by Felix Mulder
  > In this post, we're going to review the ReaderT pattern we used, as well as go through its shortcomings and our chosen solution to it.

- [Testing Coverage of Template Haskell functions](https://brandonchinn178.github.io/blog/2020/08/06/testing-coverage-of-template-haskell-functions.html) by Brandon Chinn
  > I wanted to measure coverage with `stack test --coverage`. The problem is that quasiquoters run and are spliced at compile-time.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

- [Novadiscovery is looking for a backend Haskell developer](https://bit.ly/3i1rCkB) (ad)
  > At Nova we use Haskell to create and simulate mechanistic models of diseases and treatments like cellular pathways, the immune system or tumor growth among others. We are currently building Jinko, a SaaS platform, and are looking for developers passionate about Science and coding to join us.

- [Haskell Developer at Coinberry](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/i5m9yn/jobs_intermediate_haskell_developer_position_at/)

## In brief

- [Defunctionalizing Arithmetic to an Abstract Machine](https://www.philipzucker.com/defunctionalizing-arithmetic-to-an-abstract-machine/) by Philip Zucker
  > In this case one can apply defunctionalization techniques that are often applied to lambda calculus to simpler arithmetic calculations.

- [Haskell and Elephants with Stephen Diehl](https://anchor.fm/the-virtual-world/episodes/Ep-9--Haskell-and-Elephants-with-Stephen-Diehl-ehshm2) by The Virtual World
  > On this episode, I sat with Stephen Diehl to talk about Haskell, Functional Programming, and his recent article about the cryptocurrency scene in the Haskell community.
