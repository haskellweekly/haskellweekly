Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Comparing the same web scraper in Haskell, Python, Go](https://dev.to/yujiri8/comparing-the-same-web-scraper-in-haskell-python-go-387a) by Ryan Westlund
  > There's a blog I follow that uses Wordpress, meaning its comment section mechanics and account system are as convoluted and nightmarish as Haskell's package management.

- [Document generation & Rendered Source Code](https://dev.to/german1608/document-generation-rendered-source-code-10cb) by German Robayo
  > The main goal of this #GSoC project is to build a similar tool for the Dhall configuration language.

- [Query-based compiler architectures](https://ollef.github.io/blog/posts/query-based-compilers.html) by Olle Fredriksson
  > Compilers are no longer just black boxes that take a bunch of source files and produce assembly code.

- [Splittable pseudo-random number generators in Haskell: random v1.1 and v1.2](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-29-prng-test/) by Leonhard Markert
  > In this blog post, I will focus on how we ensured that the implementation used in random v1.2 is, indeed, a high quality PRNG.

- [Template Haskell recompilation](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/772-Template_Haskell_recompilation) by Joachim Breitner
  > What happens if I have a Haskell module with Template Haskell that embeds some information from the environment (time, environment variables). Will such a module be reliable recompiled?

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.
