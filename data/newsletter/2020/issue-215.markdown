Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Hoogle Searching Overview](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/06/hoogle-searching-overview.html) by Neil Mitchell
  > In this post I'll go through three parts -- what the data file looks like, how we generate it, and how we search it.

- [Implementing HTTP/3 in Haskell](https://kazu-yamamoto.hatenablog.jp/entry/2020/06/09/155236) by Kazu Yamamoto
  > This article explains insights which I found through the implementation activities of QUIC and HTTP/3 in Haskell.

- [Making the most of Cabal](https://lukelau.me/haskell/posts/making-the-most-of-cabal/) by Luke Lau
  > Multiple GHC versions, Snapshots, Freezing, Local repositories, Source repository packages, Vendoring, Scripts, Haddocks, and Hoogle.

- [The Pain Points of Haskell: A Practical Summary](https://dixonary.co.uk/blog/haskell/pain) by Alex Dixon
  > These are a product of my own experience and that of some of my good friends at varying levels of Haskell education and practise.

- [Real-time monitoring of Fastly metrics with the Elastic Stack and Haskell](https://www.elastic.co/blog/monitoring-fastly-with-elastic-stack-and-haskell) by Tyler Langlois
  > Keeping an eye on the performance and behavior of our CDN is important to ensure we're operating at the level we expect.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## In brief

- [Bracketing and async exceptions in Haskell](https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/bracketing_and_async_exceptions_in_haskell/) by Joey Hess
  > I've been digging into async exceptions in haskell, and getting more and more concerned. In particular, `bracket` seems to be often used in ways that are not async exception safe.

- [Calling to the JVM from Haskell: Some benchmarks](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-11-inline-java-benchmarks/) by Facundo Domínguez
  > In this post, I want to argue that `inline-java` can be a good solution for integrating Haskell and Java from a perfomance standpoint.

- [Custom Markdown in Pandoc](https://dev.to/riccardoodone/custom-markdown-in-pandoc-43hf) by Riccardo Odone
  > Pandoc allows changing the AST before the output document is written.

- [Fix-ing regular expressions](https://well-typed.com/blog/2020/06/fix-ing-regular-expressions/) by Oleg Grenrus
  > We add variables, let bindings, and explicit recursion via fixed points to classic regular expressions.

- [Getting ghcide into nixpkgs](https://mpickering.github.io/ide/posts/2020-06-05-ghcide-and-nixpkgs.html) by Malte Brandy
  > In this post I want to share my experience and tell you what I learned about the nixpkgs Haskell infrastructure and ghcide.

- [Generating lenses for third party libraries](https://dev.to/piq9117/haskell-generating-lenses-for-third-party-libraries-1oik) by Ken Aguilar
  > I'm going to highlight how to generate lenses for third party libraries because when I was searching for this information it wasn't that easy to find.

- [Looking to the future of Haskell and JavaScript for Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/04/looking-to-the-future-of-haskell-and-javascript-for-plutus/) by Luite Stegeman

- [Lorentz: Introducing Complex Objects to Michelson](https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-complex-objects) by Kostya Ivanov
  > In this post, we are going to implement complex product and sum types and methods for working with them while ensuring correctness at compile-time.

- [Q-Learning with Tensors](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/6/8/q-learning-with-tensors) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Next up, we'll be using TensorFlow with our Haskell code. We'll explore an alternative form of our `FrozenLake` monad using this approach.

- [Stackage LTS 16](https://www.stackage.org/lts-16.0)

- [Template Haskell and Stream-processing programs](https://jmtd.net/log/template_haskell/streamgraph/) by Jonathan Dowland
