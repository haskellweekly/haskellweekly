Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Survey

- [2020 State of Haskell Survey](https://haskellweekly.news/survey/2020.html) by Haskell Weekly
  > The goal of this survey is to better understand what people think of the Haskell programming language, together with its ecosystem and community. Whether you have never used Haskell or you use it every day, we want to hear from you!

## Featured

- [Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation) by Simon Peyton Jones
  > The Haskell Foundation (HF) is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to broadening the adoption of Haskell, by supporting its ecosystem of tools, libraries, education, and research.

- [Making a small game with Gloss](https://herebeseaswines.net/essays/2020-11-01-making-a-small-game-with-gloss) by Claes-Magnus Berg
  > Making a game, even if you have no intention of making it real and finishing it, is good practice in any programming language.

- [Advent of Haskell 2020](https://adventofhaskell.com) by Antei & Konfy
  > Advent of Haskell is an advent calendar filled with content created by the Haskell community.

- [Composable filters using Witherable optics](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/witherable-optics) by Chris Penner
  > As it turns out, optics have a lot of different "slots" where we can experiment with different data types and constraints to get new results.

- [Create a Windows installer for your Haskell project](https://blog.patchgirl.io/haskell/2020/10/30/windows-installer-for-haskell-software.html) by Iori Matsuhara
  > In this blog post, I'll try to explain how you can create a really simple installer for your Haskell software on Windows and how to deal with external dependencies.

- [Episode 29: Bad Parts](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/29.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Even well-designed languages have rough edges. Cameron Gera and Taylor Fausak review some of the bad parts of Haskell.

- [Haskell: The Good Parts](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ShowPost?postId=14ed1d41-5ea4-4608-9c96-465443cd6e55) by Marc Scholten
  > Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced.

- [JSON Parsing from Scratch in Haskell: Error Reporting --- Part 2](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/json-parsing-from-scratch-in-haskell-3/) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > In this post, we'll finish adding simple but useful error reporting capability to our JSON parser.

- [Names are not type safety](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/) by Alexis King
  > Newtypes are useful when carefully applied, but their safety is not intrinsic, no more than the safety of a traffic cone is somehow contained within the plastic it's made of.

- [Your orphan instances are probably fine](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2020/10/29/your-orphans-are-fine.html) by Michael Peyton Jones
  > With a little bit of care, we can use orphans quite safely so long as we can avoid the problematic cases.

## In brief

- [A boring Haskell script](https://typeclasses.com/news/2020-11-haskell-script) by Julie Moronuki
  > Here, I want to show you a small script that I used to generate package override files for a project I was building with `cabal2nix`.

- [Can We Have Exhaustive Return Warning?](https://alistairb.dev/exhaustive-return-warning/) by Alistair Burrowes
  > A function like this will also need to be updated, however in this case the compiler won't help us.

- [ghc-lib-parser module count](https://blog.shaynefletcher.org/2020/10/ghc-lib-parser-module-count.html) by Shayne Fletcher
  > The build time for ghc-lib-parser is proportional to the number of modules that it contains, the less there are the faster it builds.

- [Inference in Agda](https://raw.githack.com/effectfully/inference-in-agda/master/InferenceInAgda.html)
  > This is a tutorial on how Agda infers things.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (November 2020)](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/jllzfa/monthly_hask_anything_november_2020/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

- [Profunctor Decoders? Optical Decoders?](http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2020/11/03/profunctor_decoders_optical_decoders/) by Jack Kelly
  > I started out fiddling with profunctors and arrows, but it morphed into something more lenslike for a while.

- [Sequencing Exercises in the Watcher](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/11/2/sequencing-exercises-in-the-watcher) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Our watcher will focus on one specific "current" exercise. When we're done with that, it will move us on to the next one automatically!

- [A story of an arrow and a comma](https://iokasimov.github.io/posts/2020/10/arrow-and-comma) by Murat Kasimov
  > In this article I'm going to show you what are adjoint functors about through real programming examples.

- [Transparency](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/transparency) by Michael Snoyman
  > I truly believe people are trying to improve Haskell community processes right now.

- [Whole Haskell is Best Haskell](https://semantic.org/post/whole-haskell-is-best-haskell/) by Ashley Yakeley
  > To take full advantage of what Haskell has to offer, you have to embrace the whole language.

- [Why I prefer functional programming](http://www.haskellforall.com/2020/10/why-i-prefer-functional-programming.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This post explains why I stick with functional programming, using a rationale that a non-functional programmer can relate to.
