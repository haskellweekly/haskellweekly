Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [The doomsday machine](https://tech.fretlink.com/the-doomsday-machine/) by Clément Delafargue
  > Ah, the do-notation. Is it good, is it bad; who knows? It's good for beginners, it's bad for beginners. It's considered harmful.

- [Extensions](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/extensions) by Kowainik
  > The write up provides the rough description of Extensions Technique in the Haskell compiler, therefore, is suitable for everyone even without any prior knowledge of that term.

- [Micro C, Part 4: Integrating the LLVM FFI](https://blog.josephmorag.com/posts/mcc4/) by Joseph Morag
  > Here, we'll get a taste of how to use the ffi bindings in llvm-hs to do the same thing and also to perform stricter checks on our generated llvm code.

- [Option parsing in Haskell, Part 2: A standard approach to settings in Haskell](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2020-05-14-option-parsing-2) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > That post describes how settings should be handled. This post will describe how to do that in Haskell in practice.

- [On PVP + Restrictive Bounds](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2020/05/07/on_pvp_restrictive_bounds.html) by Matt Parsons
  > The following discussion occured on the FPChat Slack. It was pasted into a gist by Emily Pillmore.

- [Reanimate: Swearing at bad documentation](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-05-10-reanimate-an-experience-report.html) by William Yao
  > Reanimate's a fairly recent addition to the Haskell ecosystem and I haven't seen a lot of discussion about actually using it, so I'd like to chime in with my own experiences with the library.

- [Sockets and Pipes](https://leanpub.com/sockets-and-pipes) by Type Classes
  > Using a handful of everyday Haskell libraries, this book walks through reading the HTTP specification and implementing it to create a web server.

- [The State of Haskell IDEs](https://mpickering.github.io/ide/posts/2020-05-08-state-of-haskell-ide.html) by Luke Lau
  > As many might be aware, the past year has seen a number of significant changes to the ecosystem, with one of the most noticeable ones being the marriage of ghcide and haskell-ide-engine.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.
