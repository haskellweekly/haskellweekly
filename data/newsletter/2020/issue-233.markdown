Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

  > In one particular feed, we found that processing took much longer than expected. We set out to investigate, and the bottleneck we found came from an unlikely place: the text library.

- [Towards Tactic Metaprogramming in Haskell](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/towards-tactics/) by Sandy Maguire
  > This blog post describes what a tactics engine is and why you want one, and is a good introduction to how in the hell we can automatically write your code for you.

- [Episode 25: Strategic Deriving](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/25.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Cameron Gera and Taylor Fausak discuss the pros and cons of various deriving strategies.

- [Force your code to break](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/force-code-to-break) by Michael Snoyman
  > I can definitely make an argument for static typing: I want to find out, as early as possible, that my code is broken.

- [Haskell Templates](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2020-10-08-haskell-templates-validation) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > I have had the idea of selling Haskell templates for a while now, and I am now getting around to validating this idea.

- [Haskellings 2: Better Configuration](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/10/12/haskellings-2-better-configuration) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > There's a few interesting things we'll learn here around using the directory package. We'll also explore how to use the Seq data structure to implement a quick Bread-First-Search algorithm!
