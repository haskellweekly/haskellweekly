Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Copilot 3](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200003164) by Ivan Perez
  > This paper presents Copilot 3, a runtime verification framework for real-time embedded systems. Additionally, it describes the framework's architecture and its implementation as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) embedded in Haskell.

- [LiquidHaskell is a GHC Plugin](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/2020/08/20/lh-as-a-ghc-plugin.lhs/) by Ranjit Jhala
  > By virtue of being a GHC plugin, LH can now: Run on entire Haskell packages; Export and import specifications across packages; Provide errors via existing GHC/i based editor tooling.

- [Season finale: Dhall documentation generator](https://dev.to/german1608/season-finale-dhall-documentation-generator-2lfn) by German Robayo
  > This is my last post and final report as part of GSoC 2020, working on the Dhall documentation generator.

- [Some More List Algorithms](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2020-08-22-some-more-list-algorithms.html) by Donnacha Oisín Kidney
  > I thought I would quickly throw out some fun snippets of Haskell I had reason to write over the past couple of weeks.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

- [Novadiscovery is looking for a backend Haskell developer](https://bit.ly/3i1rCkB) (ad)
  > At Nova we use Haskell to create and simulate mechanistic models of diseases and treatments like cellular pathways, the immune system or tumor growth among others. We are currently building Jinko, a SaaS platform, and are looking for developers passionate about Science and coding to join us.
