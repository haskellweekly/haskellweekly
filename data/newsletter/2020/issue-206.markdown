Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Introduction to GHC language extensions](https://typeclasses.com/extensions-intro) by Type Classes

- [Lessons in Managing Haskell Memory](https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html) by Fabian Thorand and Yorick Sijsling

- [The Power of Tiny DSLs](http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2020/04/03/the_power_of_tiny_dsls/index.html) by Jack Kelly
  > This means I have to compute the transformation twice: once as codeworld-api calls, and once as matrices. Or do I?

- [RecordDotSyntax language extension proposal](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282#issuecomment-608329102) by Simon Peyton Jones
  > As the shepherd for this proposal, I'm happy to say that the GHC Steering Committee has, finally, come to a conclusion: we accept the proposal, subject to final revisions, with some additional specifics about syntax.

- [A Telegram bot in Haskell on Amazon Lambda](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/770-A_Telegram_bot_in_Haskell_on_Amazon_Lambda) by Joachim Breitner
  > This led me to learn about how I write a Telegram bot in Haskell and how I can deploy such a Haskell program to Amazon Lambda.

- [Wide Haskell: Reducing your Dependencies](https://www.fosskers.ca/en/blog/wide-haskell) by Colin Woodbury
  > This post describes my recent experiments in actively reducing the number of depedencies in my Haskell projects to achieve a "wide" (not deep) dependency graph.

- [X-Ray and WAI](https://magnus.therning.org/posts/2020-04-08-000-xray-and-way.html) by Magnus Therning
  > As a first step I implemented a WAI middleware that wraps an HTTP request and reports the time it took to produce a response.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## In brief

- [Building a web app with functional programming - Haskell - part II](https://blog.patchgirl.io/haskell/2020/03/21/haskell-part-II.html) by Iori Matsuhara
  > This part will focus on the libraries used while building the backend API.

- [Compile and link a Haskell package against a local C library](https://ro-che.info/articles/2020-04-07-haskell-local-c-library) by Roman Cheplyaka
  > Let's say you want to build a Haskell package with a locally built version of a C library for testing/debugging purposes.

- [Dining Philosophers with Software Transactional Memory](https://klinger.dev/posts/2020-03-25-software-transactional-memory.html) by Christian Klinger
  > In a nutshell, STM allows you to group different variable-changing statements into atomic blocks.

- [Expand URI templates with Burrito](https://taylor.fausak.me/2020/04/05/burrito/) by Taylor Fausak
  > RFC 6570 defines a URI template as "a compact sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers through variable expansion."

- [GHC: How whitespace sensitive operator lexing works](https://blog.shaynefletcher.org/2020/04/ghc-how-whitespace-sensitive-operator.html) by Shayne Fletcher
  > The point of this is that certain operators can be ascribed different meanings depending on the classification of their occurrence and language extensions that may be in effect.

  > It's just shocking how far you can go with with just having some symbols and type constructors. But how really far can we go?

- [An intuition for reflection](https://queuea9.wordpress.com/2020/04/01/an-intuition-for-reflection/) by Aaron Stump
  > It is a property relating eliminations and constructions of datatypes. It says that folding with the constructors is the identity.
