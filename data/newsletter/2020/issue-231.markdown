Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Glasgow Haskell Compiler 9.0.1-alpha1 released](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2020-September/019286.html) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the availability of the first
alpha release in the GHC 9.0 series.

- [Being lazy without getting bloated](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2020/09/nothunks/) by Edsko de Vries
  > In this post we introduce a new library called nothunks aimed at discovering a large class of such leaks early, and helping to debug them.

- [The Cubix Framework](http://www.cubix-framework.com) by James Koppel
  > Cubix is a Haskell framework for building language-parametric programming tools.

- [Fully statically linked Haskell binaries with Bazel](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-09-30-bazel-static-haskell/) by Tweag
  > Thanks to the contribution of Will Jones of Habito, `rules_haskell`, the Haskell Bazel extension, has gained support for fully static linking of Haskell binaries.

- [Generalizing `jq` And Traversal Systems Using Optics And Standard Monads](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/traversal-systems) by Chris Penner
  > We're going to discover which properties make them useful, then see how we can replicate their most useful behaviours in Haskell using (almost entirely) pre-existing standard Haskell tools!

- [HTTP APIs with WebGear](https://haskell-explained.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2020/09/26/http-apis-with-webgear/index.html) by Raghu Kaippully
  > While Haskell has a number of libraries and frameworks for building HTTP API servers, WebGear is somewhat unique in the design space.

- [JSON Parsing from Scratch in Haskell: Error Reporting](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/json-parsing-from-scratch-in-haskell-2/) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > in this post, we'll add simple but useful error reporting capability to our JSON parser.

- [Learn Haskell on CodeWorld writing Sokoban](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/775-Learn_Haskell_on_CodeWorld_writing_Sokoban) by Joachim Breitner
  > So if you feel like learning Haskell without worrying about local installation, and while creating a reasonably fun game, head over to Haskell via Sokoban and get started!

- [Void Is a Smell](https://tech.freckle.com/2020/09/23/void-is-a-smell/) by Patrick Brisbin
  > Just this week, I and a co-worker were separately stymied by the same kind of bug. In both cases, it boiled down to mis-use of Haskell's `void` function.

## In brief

- [Haskell is not dying](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/j0w6pm/haskell_is_not_dying/) by Samuel Schlesinger
  > I feel like there have been lots of posts recently about Haskell dying or being replaced, and I just wanted to say that I don't think this is the case at all.

- [How to break the infinite loop](https://dev.to/lotz84/how-to-break-the-infinite-loop-3hii) by Tatsuya Hirose
  > Can you `break` and escape from the infinite loop as you do in an imperative programming language?

- [Learn4Haskell](https://github.com/kowainik/learn4haskell/tree/8ee297086232fc2b791b9e199542e919c0e005e5) by Kowainik
  > Learn4Haskell is a GitHub-located course that would get you into the Haskell Functional Programming world in just 4 Pull Requests.

- [RFC: A plan to gradual removal of v1- commands](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/cabal-devel/2020-September/010488.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > Dear development aware cabal users: I request you to comment on a plan to gradually remove `v1-` commands.

- [Which monads Haskell developers use: An exploratory study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167642320301313) by Ismael Figueroa
  > In this paper we present an empirical study that covers a snapshot of available packages in the Hackage repository.
