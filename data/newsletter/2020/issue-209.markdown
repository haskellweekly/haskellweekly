Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [10 Reasons to Use Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/10-reasons-to-use-haskell) by Vladislav Zavialov
  > Haskell is a blend of cutting edge research and well-tested, time-proven technology. It occupies a unique position between academia and industry.

- [Consider Haskell](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2020/04/28/consider-haskell) by Gil Mizrahi
  > In this blog post I'd like to share a bit of my thoughts on why I think Haskell is a useful and practical language to get things done (and learn a lot on the way).

- [Deriving Isomorphically](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2020-04-23-deriving-isomorphically.html) by Hans Hoeglund
  > In this post I'll present iso-deriving and show some examples of iso-deriving in action. I've packaged up all the types and classes used here in the iso-deriving package.

- [Hakyll Pt. 6 -- Pure Builds With Nix](https://robertwpearce.com/hakyll-pt-6-pure-builds-with-nix.html) by Robert Pearce
  > Learn how to make your hakyll project build pure and how to patch hakyll if you need to.

- [Learn to moonwalk with waterflow problem](https://iokasimov.github.io/posts/2020/04/waterflow) by Murat Kasimov
  > I'd like to find my own solution that would be composable, readable and involve effects.

- [overloaded-0.2.1: Overloaded:Do](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2020-04-27-overloaded-local-do.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > The `Overloaded:Do` is one of the new features of recent `overloaded 0.2.1` release. `overloaded` package uses source plugins to reinterpret syntax in different ways.

- [Property testing in depth: genvalidity's fixed-size type generators](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2020-04-28-genvalidity-improvements) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > This post announces `genvalidity-0.10.0.0` and recently released companion libraries. This post explores the changes to the generators of `Int`, `Word`, `Float`, `Double`, `Natural` and `Integer`.

- [Speeding up the Sixty compiler](https://ollef.github.io/blog/posts/speeding-up-sixty.html) by Olle Fredriksson
  > I will show the workflow and profiling tools that I use to find what to optimise in Haskell programs such as Sixty.

- [Tools for working on GHC](https://mpickering.github.io/posts/2019-06-11-ghc-tools.html) by Matthew Pickering
  > In this post we'll briefly describe some recent advancements in developer tooling which have been made possible by the move to Hadrian.

- [Writing a discord library using Polysemy](https://nitros12.github.io/writing-a-discord-library-using-polysemy/) by Ben Simms
  > Recently I've migrated my discord library from mtl/transformers to polysemy after reading as many blog posts as I could find on it.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/vacancies/#haskell-software-engineer) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## In brief

- [Class: Signature innovation is a slow burner](https://chrisdornan.com/posts/2020-04-23-class.html) by Chris Dornan
  > When Haskell initially proposed type classes as a way of systematically dealing showing and comparing user types I was not happy and avoided using them when I could for years.

- [A Servant API Testing Example From the Wild](https://vadosware.io/post/a-servant-api-testing-example-from-the-wild/) by Victor Adossi
  > I share some code snippets to test endpoints on a servant-powered API I work on.

## Show & tell

- [extended-containers](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/g7d1p8/extendedcontainers_0100_more_container_types/) by konsumlamm
  > It aims to complement the containers and unordered-containers packages by providing some more useful immutable container types.

- [hspec-tables](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/g99hoc/ann_hspectables_001_very_small_library_for/) by Marcin RzeÅºnicki
  > This is my very first Haskell library :-) It's rather small and trivial but I missed the functionality of being able to generate 'by-example' tests in HSpec.

- [ryu](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/g8oogu/fast_floating_point_to_decimal_strings/) by Lawrence Wu
  > My first library in Haskell is an attempt at porting the Ryu algorithm for floating point to decimal string conversion into pure Haskell.
