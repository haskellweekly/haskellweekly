Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 8.10.3 released](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20201219-ghc-8.10.3-released.html) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC team is happy to announce the release of GHC 8.10.3.

- [beauty and the bytestring](https://nliu.net/posts/2020-11-06-bytestring.html) by Norman Liu
  > What does Data.ByteString do differently from builtin lists, then?

- [Don't think, just defunctionalize](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/778-Donâ€™t_think%2C_just_defunctionalize) by Joachim Breitner
  > CPS-conversion and defunctionalization can help you to come up with a constant-stack algorithm.

- [How to initialize data from IHP directly to Elm](https://driftercode.com/blog/passing-flags-from-ihp-to-elm/) by Lars Lillo Ulvestad
  > Generate types, encoders and decoders for Elm automatically in IHP.

- [Improving Haskell (GHC) Error Messages](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ShowPost?postId=03e5a442-8b81-4b80-a000-29a3e7f10adf) by Marc Scholten
  > A good error message should be clear, actionable, and practical. In this aspect GHC could be a lot more user-friendly.

- [lower case haskell](https://tonyday567.github.io/posts/lowercase/) by Tony Day
  > In noodling around with stan, a wonderful tool developed with obvious care and attention by the talented kowainik troupe, I created hcount, a cheap and cheerful attempt to count symbol usage in Haskell projects.

- [Refactoring using type classes and optics](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2020-12-21-refactoring-type-classes-optics.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > This post is a case study of a refactoring in the jose library demonstrating how type classes help achieve API stability while admitting new use cases.

- [Santa Wrap](https://github.com/lucasdicioccio/santa-wrap/tree/8a8787b62d67ebe30f132295f0a214ebc4781c34) by Lucas Di Cioccio
  > The main goal for this article is to relate how to iterate quickly on a practical one short day project. Secondary goals are to pike your interest about MiniZinc and introduce you a library named minizinc-process.

- [Try.do for recoverable errors in Haskell](https://chrisdone.com/posts/try-do/) by Chris Done
  > We get a trivial, syntactically-lightweight, way to string possibly-failing actions together, while retaining all the benefits of being an unliftio-able monad.

- [Support Haskell.org](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/support-haskell-org/1686) by Rebecca Skinner
  > This year we've continued to support a significant part of the Haskell community infrastructure- including haskell.org, Hackage, Hoogle, and GHC build infrastructure.

## In brief

- [A Haskell proof of concept of validation with partial data round trip](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2020/12/21/a-haskell-proof-of-concept-of-validation-with-partial-data-round-trip/) by Mark Seemann
  > The twist is that validation, when it fails, should return not only a list of error messages; it should also retain that part of the input that was valid.

- [An introduction to property-based testing with QuickCheck](https://jesper.sikanda.be/posts/quickcheck-intro.html) by Jesper Cockx
  > I hope this post closes a gap in the current menu of tutorials for at least a few people.

- [Open Sourcing Haskellings!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/12/21/open-sourcing-haskellings) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In the last couple months we've been working on "Haskellings", an automated Haskell tutorial inspired by Rustlings.

- [Reconciling concepts from FP and OOP](https://thma.github.io/posts/2020-12-20-reconciling-fp-and-oop-concepts.html) by Thomas Mahler
  > In the following sections I will have a look at the Haskell language to see how the principles of Ad-hoc Polymorphism and Referential Transparency are covered in our favourite language.

- [Scripting the Hell out of Trello with Haskell](https://odone.io/posts/2020-12-21-scripting-the-hell-out-of-trello-in-haskell.html) by Riccardo Odone
  > Trello is excellent when it comes to one-off cards. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer any support for recurring tasks out of the box.

- [Silly Haskell Code Formatting Is Prevalent](https://yairchu.github.io/posts/silly-haskell-formatting) by Yair Chuchem
  > With proper formatting the context and parameters take whole lines. We could easily tell which part is the context, which are parameters, and which is the function output.

## Show & tell
