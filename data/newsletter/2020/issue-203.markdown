Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Announcing Neuron - Zettelkasten in Haskell](https://srid.ca/neuron-announce) by Sridhar Ratnakumar
  > Two weeks ago I learned of a note-taking method called Zettelkasten, which aims to be a superior alternative to traditional methods like outliners and mindmaps.

- [Evolving Import Style For Diff Friendliness](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2020/03/17/gradual_import_style_improvements.html) by Matt Parsons
  > This post begins with a style recommendation, continues with a script to implement it gradually in your codebase, and finishes with a discussion on relevant import styles and how they affect review quality.

- [Gain confidence with declarative programming](https://cswithbaddrawings.wordpress.com/2020/03/13/gain-confidence-with-declarative-programming/) by Brandon
  > In this post, I'll be going over what makes declarative programming different from imperative programming and how being declarative makes programs easier to understand and less prone to mistakes.

- [Git Project Management](https://dfithian.github.io/2020/03/09/git-project-management.html) by Dan Fithian
  > `hit` is a new tool for managing multiple git repositories as a project.

- [An IDE implemented using reflex](https://mpickering.github.io/posts/2020-03-16-ghcide-reflex.html) by Matthew Pickering
  > In short, I now have an IDE which works and is completely implemented using reflex which gives you a point to be able to evaluate the costs and benefits to both approaches.

- [Inferred or Specified Types? Your Choice!](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2020-03-12-expl-spec.html) by Gert-Jan Bottu
  > In this blog post, I will describe specificity, the proposal features, and why it could prove useful to you as a developer.

- [Reflex HTML Basics](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/3/2/reflex-html-basics) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > We'll start getting a feel for the syntax Reflex uses for making different HTML elements. Once we're familiar with these basics, we can compare Reflex with other frontend Haskell tools.

- [Relate intervals with Rampart](https://taylor.fausak.me/2020/03/13/relate-intervals-with-rampart/) by Taylor Fausak
  > Have you ever needed to know if two intervals overlap? I wrote Rampart, a small Haskell library to help with that.

- [The `<- pure` pattern](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-pure-pattern.html) by Neil Mitchell
  > Sometimes `<- pure` makes a lot of sense, avoiding some common bugs.

- [Visual Arrow Syntax](https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2020-03-12-visual-arrow-syntax.html) by Jasper Van der Jeugt
  > _Not to be taken seriously._ Haskell is great building at DSLs --- which are perhaps the ultimate form of slacking off at work.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.
