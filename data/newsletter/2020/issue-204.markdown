Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 8.10.1 released](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20200324-ghc-8.10.1-released.html) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC team is happy to announce the availability of GHC 8.10.1.

- [Building a web app with functional programming - Haskell - part I](https://blog.patchgirl.io/haskell/2020/03/08/haskell-part-I.html) by Iori Matsuhara
  > This post talks about my feedback with Haskell on this project and whether I consider it production ready.

- [Built with Hakyll -- Part 02: Custom Fields](https://blog.ysndr.de/posts/internals/2020-03-22-built-with-hakyll-part-2.html) by Yannik Sander
  > While setting up the structure of this blog I found the "need" of having some more fields available though. This is how I started to adapt some implementations I found on the internet, and developed my own.

- [Blaze: Lightweight Html Generation](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/3/9/blaze-lightweight-html-generation) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In the next couple weeks, we'll consider two simple libraries we can use to generate HTML code. This week, we'll look at the Blaze HTML library.

- [Cheatsheet: Option (in Rust) vs Maybe (in Haskell)](https://notes.iveselov.info/programming/cheatsheet-rust-option-vs-haskell-maybe) by Ivan Veselov
  > This is meant to be for people coming from Haskell to Rust or vice versa who want to quickly find the name of corresponding function on optional values.

- [Haskell IDE 2020](https://blog.samibadawi.com/2020/03/haskell-ide-2020.html) by Sami Badawi
  > I spent some time getting a working Haskell environment on OS X.

- [The problem with adding functions to compact regions](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2020/03/functions-in-compact-regions/) by Ömer Sinan Ağacan
  > The question why functions cannot be added to compact regions often comes up in GHC's IRC channel, and because I don't work on or with compact regions, every time I see the question I try to remember the reason for why functions can't be moved to a compact region, often coming up with incorrect answers on the way.

- [Setting up Ghcide in Ubuntu with Nixpkgs](https://gvolpe.github.io/blog/setting-up-ghcide-nixpkgs-ubuntu/) by Gabriel Volpe
  > This is the reason why I am writing this blog post. Aim at those who use Nixpkgs like me, in a different distro other than NixOS.

- [Zipping Trees, Part 1](https://jmorag.netlify.com/posts/zip-tree1/) by Joseph Morag
  > This problem has you perform various incremental operations on a rose tree, such as inserting and deleting nodes and visiting adjacent nodes in the tree.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.
