Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Graphics in Haskell: linear algebra](https://das.li/articles/linear.html) by Alex Stuart
  > I'll explain what I've found most useful for workaday tasks, but there seem to be more cool techniques, like sparse representation, available to the fully committed Haskell/graphics dhampir

- [Go Sensei: Lessons in Full Stack Development --- Planning ](https://maxfieldchen.com/posts/2020-07-22-go-sensei-full-stack-development-1.html) by Maxfield Chen
