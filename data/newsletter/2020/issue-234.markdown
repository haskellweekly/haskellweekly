Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Episode 27: Interview Questions](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/27.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Learn how to answer common technical interview questions with Haskell. Cameron Gera and Taylor Fausak discuss Chris Penner's blog post.

- [Episode 1: The New Random](https://www.compositional.fm/random) by Compositional Podcast
  > A little group consisting of Alexey Kuleshevich, Alexey Khudyakov as well as the two guests of this episode got together to improve the random library both in terms of quality and performance.

- [Does the idea of `-XGHC2021` excite you?](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/je1t82/does_the_idea_of_xghc2021_excite_you/) by Joachim Breitner
  > Among the plethora of GHC extensions that we support, many are pretty accepted, or safe, or just optional polish. We could identify such a base set, and make it so that `{-# LANGUAGE GHC2021 #-}` turns on all of them.

- [Flashblast - A tool for generating language learning flashcards](https://homotopic.tech/projects/flashblast.html) by Dan Firth
  > Flashblast is a command line application for creating anki flashcards from a dhall config.

- [Bounded Space Automata](https://blog.cofree.coffee/2020-10-17-bounded-space-automata/)
  > This blog post walks through my experience attempting to use `Store`, `Representable` in Haskell to implement Rule 110, difficulty finding a suitable `Representable` instance, and then a pivot to Idris where I was able to solve the problem using the finite set type `Fin n`.

## In brief

- [The coin change problem in Haskell](https://medium.com/@aronwith1a/the-coin-change-problem-in-haskell-bc1fa89cd09c) by Aron
  > We can alleviate the hardships by employing dynamic programming with memoization and utilizing a neat little property of the problem.

- [Release a book about math and programming in Haskell](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2020-October/132825.html) by Liu Xinyu
  > I recently released a book about mathematics and programming in github. There are 7 chapters together with 108 problems as exercise.

- [Watching Files with FS-Notify!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/10/19/watching-files-with-fs-notify) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > This week, we get familiar with the fsnotify package, which lets us watch files and directories and take actions in our program when they change!

- [Why Fintech Companies Use Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/functional-programming-in-fintech) by Roman Alterman

## Show & tell

- [Abstractions in Context](https://gumroad.com/l/CLyzT) by William Yao
  > Learn Haskell abstractions the easy way --- with real-world examples and context. You'll learn common patterns in Haskell, how to implement them yourself, and what their benefits and drawbacks are.

- [jsonifier](https://github.com/nikita-volkov/jsonifier/tree/0fb9a576b4915bc8f1899d836e51fc67f532db9c) by Nikita Volkov
  > The API consists of just a few functions and achieves performance that gets up to 3 times better than that of "aeson" in typical use-cases.

- [TopShell](https://github.com/topshell-language/topshell/tree/bca885be88c364864f3c79927b62558c6b6cdf7a) by Joakim Ahnfelt-RÃ¸nne
