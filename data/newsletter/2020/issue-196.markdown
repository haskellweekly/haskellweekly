Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haskell Problems For a New Decade](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/decade.html) by Stephen Diehl
  > The problems we work on in the present are those that shape the future, and often the choice of problems is what matters more than anything else.

- [One Haskell IDE to rule them all](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/01/one-haskell-ide-to-rule-them-all.html) by Neil Mitchell
  > The Haskell IDE Engine and Ghcide teams are joining forces on a single IDE.

- [Policeman in da Bristol city](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/policeman-bristol) by Kowainik
  > There is a need to automate this process and that is why we have created policeman --- your versioning guard.

- [Folding lists](https://typeclasses.com/phrasebook/folding-lists) by Type Classes
  > The functions `foldr`, `foldMap`, and `fold` are convenient ways to combine all of the elements of a list.

- [Hpack: A Simpler Package Format](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/1/27/hpack-a-simpler-package-format) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > But `.cabal` files have some weaknesses, as we'll explore. Luckily, there's another tool out there called Hpack.

- [Help! My Haskell program consumes more memory the longer it runs](https://jacobstanley.io/help-my-haskell-program-consumes-more-memory-the-longer-it-runs/) by Jacob Stanley
  > You look at the offending code and you're updating a few maps but there doesn't seem to be anything going on that would use a lot of memory.

- [Case study: migrating from lens to optics](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2020-01-25-case-study-migration-from-lens-to-optics.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > Some time ago I commented on Reddit, that there are no real experience reports about migrating "real world Haskell codebases" from `lens` to `optics`. So I decided to do an experiment.

- [Property testing in depth: The size parameter](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2020-01-28-property-testing-size) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > This post explains the size parameter of a property testing generator, and expands on its tradeoffs.

- [vmap in Haskell](http://blog.ezyang.com/2020/01/vmap-in-haskell/) by Edward Z. Yang
  > Semantically, a vmap is exactly equivalent to a map in Haskell; the key difference is that operations run under a vmap are vectorized.

- [Transformations on Applicative Concurrent Computations](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/transformations-on-applicative-concurrent-computations) by Román González
  > In this blog post, we will discuss some of the drawbacks of using the `Concurrently` type when composing sub-routines.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.
