Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [This is your chance to influence the future of software development](https://www.developereconomics.net/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=haskell&utm_campaign=haskell_newsletter) (ad)
  > Join 30,000+ developers around the world who are taking the Developer Economics survey and leave your mark! You may win one out of USD $15,000 worth of prizes or $1,000 cash for referring other developers to take the survey. Open to developers only, until August 10th. Hurry up - take the survey!

- [A fork of Haskell prometheus-client](https://qnikst.github.io/posts/2020-07-04-prometheus.html) by Alexander Vershilov
  > For the last few months, I slowly work on improving the prometheus-client library. And I'd like to share some details of that work.

- [Automatic UI's for Command Lines with cmdargs](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2020/07/automatic-uis-for-command-lines-with.html) by Neil Mitchell
  > I always thought it would be a neat trick to transform that into a web page, to make it easier to explore command line options interactively.

- [Beautiful Mutable Values](https://mutable.jle.im) by Justin Le
  > Take back the power of mutable objects with all the safety and explicit state of Haskell.

- [Composing predicates](https://dev.to/gillchristian/composing-predicates-30jb) by Christian Gill
  > A few days ago I was writing some validation functions that were basically a composition of several other predicates.

- [How I integrate ghcid with vim/neovim](https://ro-che.info/articles/2020-07-08-integrate-ghcid-vim) by Roman Cheplyaka
  > All we need is a few tweaks to make them play well together. This article describes the setup, which I've been happily using for 1.5 years now.

- [Introducing hasql-queue](https://jfischoff.github.io/blog/introducing-hasql-queue.html) by Jonathan Fischoff
  > I've recently released hasql-queue, a PostgreSQL backed queue for the hasql ecosystem.

- [Modeling state machines with dependent types in Haskell: Part 1](https://www.poberezkin.com/posts/2020-06-29-modeling-state-machine-dependent-types-haskell-1.html) by Evgeny Poberezkin
  > Modeling state transition in types offers a simple alternative to ensure that only allowed state transitions can be implemented - the code that attempts to perform the state transition that is not allowed will not compile.

- [Retrie: Haskell refactoring made easy](https://engineering.fb.com/open-source/retrie/) by Facebook Engineering
  > We've open-sourced Retrie, a code refactoring tool for Haskell that makes codemodding faster, easier, and safer.
