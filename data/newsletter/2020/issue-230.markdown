Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Reanimate v1.0](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2020-September/132745.html) by David Himmelstrup

- [Strategic Deriving](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/deriving) by Kowainik
  > But what exactly is deriving, how does it work and what pitfalls can it bring? What are deriving strategies and how do you get a habit of using them regularly?

- [Sockets and Pipes](https://leanpub.com/sockets-and-pipes) by Type Classes
  > Sockets and Pipes is not an introduction to Haskell; it is an introduction to writing software in Haskell.

  > How good is Haskell's lazy sort actually?

## In brief

- [Haskell's Children](https://owenlynch.org/posts/2020-09-16-haskells-children/) by Owen Lynch
  > I find myself simply not as excited about Haskell as I used to be. What changed?

- [In the computer](https://chris-martin.org/2020/in-the-computer) by Chris Martin
  > When people talk about "algebraic reasoning", explanations fall flat because we neglect to first figure out kind of reasoning we're contrasting it against.

- [MuniHac 2020](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2020/09/munihac-2020/) by Well-Typed
  > We enjoyed attending virtual MuniHac and would like to thank our co-organisers TNG for all the work they put into planning, hosting and and running the event.

- [Optimised Row Columnar for Haskell](https://www.huwcampbell.com/posts/2020-09-18-announcing-orc-haskell.html) by Huw Campbell
  > I are proud to announce a new Apache ORC library for Haskell which I am releasing as open source under the Affero General Public License.
