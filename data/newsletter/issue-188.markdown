Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haskell Support in Mainstream IDEs](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/mainstream-ides-haskell) by Chris Done

- [Advent of Optics: Day 4](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/advent-of-optics-04) by Chris Penner
  > Since I'm releasing a book on practical lenses and optics later this month I thought it would be fun to do a few of this year's Advent of Code puzzles using as many obscure optics features as possible!

- [Four ways to partially apply constraint tuples](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2019/11/30/four-ways-to-partially-apply-constraint-tuples/) by Ryan Scott

  > Let's instead take a 10,000-foot overview of how Haskell's design makes this level of bug-freeness and maintainability not just possible, but easy.

- [The revolution in computing education at school](https://codesync.global/media/revolution-in-computing-education-at-school-opportunity-and-challenge-cmldn19/) by Simon Peyton Jones
  > The new English National Curriculum in computing says that every child should learn computer science, as a foundational subject discipline like maths or natural science, from primary school onwards.
