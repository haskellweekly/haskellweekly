## News from the Haskell community

-   [Student applications are now open](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2017-04-25-student-applications-open.html)

    > We are now happy to announce that we have opened student applications for Summer of Haskell 2017. The application period is open until the 6th of May, so that should give you plenty of time. At this time, we are also actively seeking mentors. In case you would like to mentor a project, please let us know. Thanks to the generous donations of our sponsors, we will be able to sponsor around 10 students this year.

-   [BayHac 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5lgjzYOvyYNchlkMzvDqd1F6gS-COCDo)

    Presentations by Julie Moronuki, John Wiegley, R&#xfa;nar Bjarnason, Gabriella Gonzalez, Chris Smith, Doug Beardsley, James Bowen, Luite Stegeman, Greg Hale, Tikhon Jelvis, Dimitri DeFigueiredo, Adelbert Chang, John Leo, Judah Jacobson, Frederick Mayle, and Sandy Maguire.

-   [Become a curator](https://github.com/fpco/stackage/blob/8b9d77980df221f393580438bedb9787f50922fc/become-a-curator.md)

    > We are looking to expand the stackage curator team! As a Stackage curator you will help the community by curating and publishing the widely used nightly and LTS snapshots: Collections of packages that are guaranteed to play well together. All curators are volunteers.

-   [The water jug problem in Hedgehog](http://clrnd.com.ar/posts/2017-04-21-the-water-jug-problem-in-hedgehog.html)

    > Let's try Hedgehog with the water jug problem. You have 2 water jugs that you can either fill or empty. One has 5 litter capacity and the other 3. You win by leaving 4 litters in the big one.

-   [Veggies: Haskell code generation from scratch](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/719-veggies__Haskell_code_generation_from_scratch)

    > To make that goal of a formally verified compiler more feasible, I set out and implemented code generation from GHC's intermediate language Core to LLVM IR, with simplicity as the main design driving factor.

-   [Haskell success stories](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/04/haskell-success-stories)

    > I think we have a problem in the Haskell community. We all know that using Haskell to create a simple web service, a CRUD app, a statically linked command line tool, or a dozen other things is not only possible, but commonplace, trivial, and not even noteworthy.

-   [Parse Ruby objects in Haskell](https://filib.io/posts/2017-04-24-parse-ruby-objects-in-haskell.html)

    > In 2015 I released my first Haskell project ruby-marshal. It's a package that uses the binary package to parse Ruby objects serialised with Marshal.dump. I wrote it in my spare time because I was curious to know whether I could devise a strategy to incrementally migrate legacy Ruby on Rails applications over to Haskell without the risk associated with a full rewrite.

-   [Shipping Haskell via Homebrew](http://chrispenner.ca/posts/homebrew-haskell)

    > One thing that isn't so great is Haskell's story for distributing code to non-Haskellers. `stack install` is great, but most folks don't have Stack installed and compiling Haskell projects from source is a lengthy process. These barriers prevented me from sharing my Haskell projects for a long time.

-   [My "Haskell in production" story](https://medium.com/@djoyner/my-haskell-in-production-story-e48897ed54c)

    > These last two problems in particular made me glad that I'd chosen Haskell for this project. I'm sure they could have been solved in Go, but the elegance and concision of the Haskell-based solution is impressive.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Hedgehog](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog),
a modern property-based testing system in the spirit of QuickCheck.

Send us a message [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/haskellweekly) to nominate next week's package!
