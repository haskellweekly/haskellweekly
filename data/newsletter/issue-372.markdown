- [Developer Nation Survey just launched - Win a MacBook Pro & more!](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell&utm_medium=nl_1) (ad)
  > Participate in the latest [Developer Nation survey](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell&utm_medium=nl_1), accessible to all developers and no-code software creators, to share what you desire the most. Is it improved documentation, a genuine DevOps culture, alternative tools, or novel technologies the top priorities for developers at present? [Take the survey!](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell&utm_medium=nl_1)

- [Derived Instances Can Break Smart Constructors, Too](https://jezenthomas.com/2023/06/derived-instances-can-break-smart-constructors/) by Jezen Thomas
  > When you have a newtype which wraps some primitive text value, it can be tempting to ask the compiler to derive the `FromJSON` instance using the `GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` language extension.

  > This is not only a great appetizer for casually browsing the lib, but also features loads of small examples that can be copypasted and played around with, cutting the whole path from I want to use this to I use this short.
