  > If you frequently wander down the dark alleys of the computer science neighborhood of the internet, it won’t be too long before you bump into a strange man in a trench coat who says, "Hey, kid ... you ever try Functional Programming?"

- [A dead-simple web stack in Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-16-a-dead-simple-web-stack.html) by William Yao
  > Haskell has a proliferation of libraries to choose from for all of your basic backend needs, from logging to database access to routing and web server definition.

- [Winter is coming even more quickly](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/758-Winter_is_coming_even_more_quickly) by Joachim Breitner
  > I explain how I improved the performance of an interpreter for WebAssembly written in Haskell by plucking some low-hanging fruit.

- [Sum algebraic data types in C](https://nullbuffer.com/2019/11/15/algebraic_c.html) by Alessio Chiapperini
  > One can say that sum types feel a lot like a combination of unions and enumerations, and that’s true, in fact we’ll see how to implement various (sum) algebraic data types in C.

- [Multiple public libraries in a single Cabal package](https://fgaz.me/posts/2019-11-14-cabal-multiple-libraries/) by Francesco Gazzetta
  > In summer 2018, during my last GSoC, I developed the "multiple public libraries in a single package" Cabal feature. In this long overdue post I explain why and how to use the feature.

- [Time Travelling and Fixing Bugs with Property-Based Testing](https://wickstrom.tech/programming/2019/11/17/time-travelling-and-fixing-bugs-with-property-based-testing.html) by Oskar Wickström
  > This tutorial is based on a simple but realistic system under test (SUT), aiming to show some ways you can test and find bugs in such logic using PBT.

- [Setting up a Haskell environment](https://www.47deg.com/blog/setting-up-haskell/) by Alejandro Serrano
