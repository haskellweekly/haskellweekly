Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Celebrating the release of Amazonka 2.0](https://exploring-better-ways.bellroy.com/celebrating-the-release-of-amazonka-2-0.html) by Mike Webb
  > Today, we at Bellroy are pleased to discuss our role in the the 2.0 release of Amazonka — a vital Haskell package providing bindings for the AWS (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure - and how we think about open source.  
  
- [GHC plugin for HLint](https://www.haskellforall.com/2023/09/ghc-plugin-for-hlint.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > At work I was recently experimenting with running hlint (the widely used Haskell linting program) as a GHC plugin. One reason why I was interested in this is because we have a large (6000+ module) Haskell codebase at work, and I wanted to see if this would make it cheaper to run hlint on our codebase.

- [XML stream processing with Haskell](https://martin.hoppenheit.info/blog/2023/xml-stream-processing-with-haskell/) by Martin Hoppenheit
  > Memory-efficient processing of large XML documents requires the use of a streaming parser. This post gives an introduction to XML stream processing with the Haskell programming language, in particular to the streaming API of the xml-conduit package.

- [Nixify your haskell project: Introduction](https://zero-to-flakes.com/blog/nixify-haskell-project-intro) by Shivaraj B H
  > This is the start of a series of blog posts aimed at simplifying Haskell development & packaging workflow using Nix. In this post, we begin the series by nixifying a Haskell application that uses PostgreSQL database and package it for end-users to run with one command.
  
- [Serokell’s Work on GHC: Dependent Types](https://serokell.io/blog/ghc-dependent-types-in-haskell) by Serokell GHC team
  > In the past month, we have achieved two significant milestones, the implementation of part 1 of visible forall and improved name resolution and type checking of type patterns.
  
- [The Haskell Unfolder Episode 11: Haskell at ICFP](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/09/haskell-unfolder-episode-11-haskell-at-icfp/) by Andres Löh, Edsko de Vries
  > In this episode, Andres and Edsko will talk about Edsko’s visit to ICFP (the International Conference on Functional Programming), the Haskell Symposium, and HIW (the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop) from 4-9 September 2023 in Seattle. 
  
- [UK air traffic control meltdown](https://jameshaydon.github.io/nats-fail/) by James Haydon
  > Analysis of the bug that caused the UK air traffic control meltdown, with Haskell code

## In brief

- [dear-imgui-2.2.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/dear-imgui-2-2-0/7553) by wiz
  > dear-imgui: Haskell bindings for Dear ImGui is out, bringing fresh dear-imgui upstream and a bunch of improvements.

- [fourmolu-0.14.0.0 released](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-fourmolu-0-14-0-0-released/7540) by Brandon Chinn
  > Mostly just merging changes in from the recent Ormolu 0.7.2.0 release.
  
- [LambdaSound 1.0.0 - A sound synthesizing library](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/lambdasound-1-0-0-a-sound-synthesizing-library/7572) by Simon
  > LambdaSound is a library for synthesizing sounds purely in Haskell with various combinators. The generated sounds can be directly played or saved to a WAV audio file.

## Show & tell

- [A basic graphical text editor written in Haskell](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/a-basic-graphical-text-editor-written-in-haskell/7551) by ssddq
  > At the start, my goal was to learn how Vulkan and GPU programming/rendering worked in general; over time, this slowly morphed into trying to write a streaming-based text editor.
  
- [Formally verified WebAssembly using Coq and Extism](https://dylibso.com/blog/formally-verified-webassembly-plugins/) by Zach Shipko
  > Using Coq extracted to Haskell with the Extism Haskell PDK we can create verified algorithms that get converted to Haskell code wrapped into an Extism plugin and compiled to WebAssembly using wasi32-wasi-ghc.
  
- [Haskell Foundation DevOps Weekly Log, 2023-09-06](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/devops-weekly-log-2023-09-06/7537) by Bryan Richter
  > Although my roadmap is still basically the one I laid out a couple posts back, I have been ill for part of last week and working on a few little side quests for the Haskell Foundation in the remainder of the time.
