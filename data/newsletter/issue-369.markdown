Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 9.6.2 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-6-2-is-now-available/6308?u=taylorfausak) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.2. This release is primarily a bug-fix release addressing a few issues found in 9.6.1.

- [Stack version 2.11.1](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-stack-2-11-1/6287?u=taylorfausak) by Mike Pilgrem

- [Haskell Language Server 2.0.0.0 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-language-server-2-0-0-0-is-now-available/6289?u=taylorfausak) by Zubin Duggal
  > This is a fairly small release, marking the start of a new versioning scheme where HLS and all the included packages in the distribution will be versioned in lockstep.

- [All Cats Are Grey](https://github.com/JeanHuguesdeRaigniac/effects-landscape/blob/55b7e179eb8501b994372f62f47458c792a87d08/v1/README.md) by Jean-Hugues de Raigniac
  > In the previous article, we described how to use 10 effect libraries to run a sample application with common effects: writer, state, reader and error. By comparing them, we were able to highlight a pattern in their usage. Could we standardize it further and erase library details? Yes!

- [Competitive programming in Haskell: parsing with an NFA](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2023/05/24/competitive-programming-in-haskell-parsing-with-an-nfa/) by Brent Yorgey
  > In this problem, we have to decide which words can be made by concatenating atomic element symbols.

- [Parsing Diff Output in Haskell](https://www.prborges.com/2023/parsing-diff-in-haskell/) by Pedro Borges
  > I describe here a parser for diff output written in Haskell using Attoparsec, a monadic parser combinator library designed to be fast and efficient.

- [Refactoring error messages in Haskell programs. Who cares about K9 composers?](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2023-05-15-FP-refactor-errors-p0.html) by Robert Peszek
  > In this post I will talk about improving error messages. We will also discuss dogs which compose music.

- [Sixteen Days of Haskell](https://codelyrical.com/sixteen-days-of-haskell/) by Matt Gregg
  > I had pre-ordered Effective Haskell on a beta program, but had forgotten about it until now. But, I'd said it, it was out there, I was doing Advent of Code in Haskell for 2022.

- [A Vulkan-based 3D Chess Game + Libraries](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/13m7ow3/a_vulkanbased_3d_chess_game_libraries/) by Michael Szvetits
  > Seeing people publishing their Tic Tac Toe games here, I decided to show my fully functional, documented, local 3D chess game written in Haskell.
