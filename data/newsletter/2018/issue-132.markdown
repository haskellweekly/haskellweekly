Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Survey

The second annual [state of Haskell survey](https://airtable.com/shr8G4RBPD9T6tnDf)
started last week on the 1st and continues until the 15th.
More than 2,800 people filled out the survey already.
If you already filled it out:
Thank you!
Please share it so we can get a good picture of the Haskell community.
If you have not filled it out yet:
We want to hear from you!
Please take a few minutes to fill it out.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.6.2 released](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/ghc-8.6.2-released) by Ben Gamari

    > The GHC team is very happy to announce the availability of GHC 8.6.2, a bugfix release to GHC 8.6.1. The 8.6 release fixes several regressions present in 8.6.1.

-   [Hakyll part 1: Setup & initial customization](https://robertwpearce.com/hakyll-pt-1-setup-and-initial-customization.html) by Robert Pearce

    > First post in a series on making & customizing a static site with Hakyll.

-   [Exceptionally monadic error handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13430) by Jan Malakhovski

    > We notice that the type of `catch :: c a -> (e -> c a) -> c a` operator is a special case of monadic bind operator `(>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b` and the semantic (surprisingly) matches.

-   [Lambda the Ultimate pattern factory](https://github.com/thma/LtuPatternFactory/tree/1be9521591f8a7f06b35a7ae5929e7beaf0b8e43) by Thomas Mahler

    > Recently, while re-reading through the Typeclassopedia I thought it would be a good exercise to map the structure of software design-patterns to the concepts found in the Haskell type class library and in functional programming in general.

-   [Haskell at FINN.no](https://tech.finn.no/2018/10/18/haskell-at-finn-no/) by Sjur Millidahl

    > Haskell is a purely functional programming language, with a powerful type system. The ability to express intent using types brings correctness, and the composition of a large program as small, independent building blocks makes it easy to reason about the code.

-   [Haskell by example: Utopian tree](https://dev.to/supermanitu/haskell-by-example---utopian-tree-1da2) by Jan van BrÃ¼gge

    > In this series we solve coding challenges from Hackerrank in Haskell in a proper, functional way. A Utopian Tree has two growth spurts every year, one in spring and one in summer.

-   [My experience upgrading GHC, build tools, and dev tools](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/9tpfo2/my_experience_upgrading_ghc_build_tools_and_dev/) by Matt Renaud

    > I went through the process of setting up my environment again and wanted to document my process and the pain points I ran into.

-   [Signal processing in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/2018/11/05/signal-processing) by Rinat Stryungis

    > Today I would like to tell you about my work in the laboratory of the Physics Department of Moscow State University, where I study for a Master's degree.

-   [The trouble with typed errors](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/11/03/trouble_with_typed_errors.html) by Matt Parsons

    > What we really want is: Order independence, no boilerplate, easy composition, and easy decomposition.

-   [Waargonaut the JSONer](https://qfpl.io/posts/waargonaut-the-jsoner/) by Sean Chalmers

    > Waargonaut is a Haskell library for encoding/decoding/manipulating JSON. The design and development of which has been driven by a dissatisfaction with the current status quo of JSON libraries in Haskell.
