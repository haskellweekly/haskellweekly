Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [The Little Typer Interview](https://corecursive.com/023-little-typer-and-pie-language/) by Adam Gordon Bell

    > You can write more correct software and even rigorous mathematical proofs. Let's learn about dependent types with Dan and David.

-   [Monadic Party](https://monadic.party)

    > It is the second edition of a Haskell summer school in PoznaÅ„, Poland. This time we have three tracks and as usual great speakers. The CFP is open and we have a scholarship program for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

-   [Almost time](https://typeclasses.com/news/2018-12-almost-time) by Julie Moronuki

    > We are excited to announce that a new course, Timepieces, will be beginning next week. This course is going to be about building basically the same project, a native GUI clock app, with different libraries so we can compare them.

-   [Building terminal user interfaces in Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/building-tuis-in-haskell) by Robert Bobbett

    > In this month's webinar, Tom Sydney Kerckhove will demonstrate just how easy it is to get started with Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs). As a recap, TUIs are text-based user interfaces for use from a terminal.

-   [Detecting the undetectable: Custom type errors for stuck type families](https://kcsongor.github.io/report-stuck-families/) by Csongor Kiss

    > Anyone who has written or used one of these libraries will know that despite the authors' best efforts, there are still many occasions where a wall of text jumps out, leaving us puzzled as to what went wrong.

-   [Introduction to state machine testing: Part 3](https://qfpl.io/posts/intro-to-state-machine-testing-3/) by Andrew McMiddlin

    > We're going to look at why Hedgehog required our state and input types to be parameterized on a type constructor, what the `Var`, `Symbolic` and `Concrete` types are all about, and why we need `HTraversable` instances for our inputs.

-   [Laziness quiz](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/12/04/laziness_quiz.html) by Matt Parsons

    > Do you understand laziness? It's okay if you don't. Most people don't. It can be somewhat surprising when something actually gets evaluated in Haskell, even when you're using bang patterns.

-   [Lens by Example: Writing traversals](https://lens-by-example.chrispenner.ca/articles/traversals/writing-traversals) by Chris Penner

    > Most lens tutorials show you how to use and compose traversals, but most skim over how to *write* complex traversals. Let's dive in!

-   [Moving to GitLab](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2018-December/016613.html) by Ben Gamari

    > A few weeks ago I wrote to this list proposing that we consider moving GHC's development infrastructure to GitLab. While the original proposal provided a small test instance to play with, it wasn't complete enough to use in earnest.

## Jobs

-   [Haskell Engineer at Mercury in San Francisco](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/a33krh/mercury_is_hiring_a_haskell_engineer_sf_fulltime/)

    > Mercury is a bank for tech startups. We're building a product that will power the future of American industry. This turns out to be pretty ambitious for a team of eight, so we're bringing one more product-minded engineer on board to help us achieve it.

-   [Internship at Kiel University](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/a1toop/haskellrelated_summer_internship_in_germany/)

    > We'd be very happy to host a motivated student, who is keen to improve our compiler for the functional logic programming language Curry in terms of performance.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [`nonempty-containers`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonempty-containers-0.1.0.0),
a library that provides non-empty variants of `containers` data types.
