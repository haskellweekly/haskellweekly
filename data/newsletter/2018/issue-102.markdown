Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Using Cloud Haskell to write a type-safe distributed chat](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/cloud-haskell/)

    > Cloud Haskell is a set of libraries that combines the power of Haskell's type system with Erlang's style of concurrency and distributed programming.

-   [Strictness surprises in PureScript lazy lists](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/griba/lazy_lists_on_strict_purescript)

    > It seems that strictness is playing a dirty trick here, evaluating the second cons parameter beforehand against our interest, but strict evaluation is in the nature of PureScript.

-   [Transforming transformers](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/04/10/transforming_transformers.html)

    > There's a kind fellow named lunaris on the FPChat slack channel that shares exceptionally good advice. Unfortunately, due to the ephemeral nature of Slack, a lot of this advice is lost to history.

-   [Dynamic programming in Haskell](https://whatthefunctional.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/dynamic-programming-in-haskell/)

    > Attempting to program a dynamic programming algorithm in Haskell has helped me understand the fundamental principles behind dynamic programming in a way that I wasn't able to when I learned it from an imperative programming perspective.

-   [Your first web application with Spock](https://haskell-at-work.com/episodes/2018-04-09-your-first-web-application-with-spock.html)

    > The Spock web framework for Haskell gives you a light but complete foundation to build web servers on, be it for traditional server-side rendered applications, or APIs for single-page applications.

-   [Coffee, curries, and monads: My journey through Haskell](https://medium.com/@fintan.halpenny/coffee-curries-and-monads-my-journey-through-haskell-5a199bab7a3f)

    > What I am going to do is tell you a little about myself, my programming journey, and why I enjoy programming in Haskell. Hopefully it will encourage you to try it out and witness your own joy with the language.

-   [Property based integration testing using Haskell!](https://functional.works-hub.com/learn/property-based-integration-testing-using-haskell-6c25c)

    > This article doesn't require any special functional programming techniques and can be replicated everywhere, but using a functional programming language makes this easier.

-   [A catamorphic lambda-calculus interpreter](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2018/04/08/catamorphic-lc-interpreter.html)

    > I was playing around with `recursion-schemes`, which is pretty cool. It's very nice to be able to define interpreters like this, so my immediate thought was: can we do this for the lambda-calculus?

-   [The monad complaint pipeline](https://argumatronic.com/posts/2018-04-07-monad-complaints.html)

    > We are a relatively small community, but we're maybe a little chatty, maybe have a little too much free time waiting for something to compile. Hence we are engaged in near constant internecine war over build tools and the like.

-   [Lightning fast CI for Haskell projects](https://blog.roman-gonzalez.ca/post/172746394387/lightning-fast-ci-for-haskell-projects)

    > I've been working in a few projects at a time in Haskell for the past year, and one point that has been dragging is how much time it takes for a CI job to finish, given this, I started to experiment with other solutions to improve my build feedback loop.

## Jobs

-   [ITProTV seeking Software Developer in Gainesville, Florida](https://functionaljobs.com/jobs/9080-software-engineer-developer-at-itprotv)

    > ITPro.TV is a fast-growing digital media business that focuses on continuing education in technical domains. We are currently accepting applications for full-stack software professionals to join our small but talented multidisciplinary team.

-   [Anduril Industries is hiring in Orange County](https://www.anduril.com)

    > Come write Haskell, Rust, and Nix (and some C++ when necessary) to make autonomous robots and drones go! If you like FP, interfacing with hardware, and solving problems in detection, tracking, and autonomous vehicle control, send a note to <travis@anduril.com>
