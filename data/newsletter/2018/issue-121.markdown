Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Goals for GHC 8.8](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2018-August/016120.html)

    > Since GHC 8.6 is almost released it's time to start thinking about our goals for 8.8, which will branch in November. I have added the items that I know are in-flight to the 8.8 status page. If you have a project that you would like to see present in 8.8 then please do add it as well.

-   [Announcing Eta v0.8.6](https://blog.eta-lang.org/https-blog-eta-lang-org-announcing-eta-v0-8-6-e8b63c92c6ca)

    > Featuring reproducible builds, `base-4.11.1.0`, and Backpack. The Eta team is happy to announce a new version of Eta --- v0.8.6! Etlas v1.5.0 is also released and is required to use the newer features.

-   [Small assets without the headache: Minification made easy with Elm 0.19](https://elm-lang.org/blog/small-assets-without-the-headache)

    > I am excited to finally share this release publicly! I hope it will help you out, whether you are learning your first programming language or on your way to 300k lines of code at work. As folks with 50k+ lines upgrade to Elm 0.19, I encourage you to share your new asset sizes and compile times.

-   [The Joy of Haskell: What is happening](https://joyofhaskell.com/posts/2018-08-06-announcement.html)

    > Lately, we've been looking at all we have to write --- the partially finished parts as well as the bare stubs populating the book repository and have made a decision: Joy of Haskell is properly two books, not one.

-   [Announcing Haskell From Scratch beginners course](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2018/8/20/announcing-haskell-from-scratch-beginners-course)

    > This week we have a huge announcement we've been working towards for a long time. One of the main goals of this blog has been to create content to make it easy for newcomers to learn Haskell. We've now reached the culmination of that goal with our brand new Haskell From Scratch course.

-   [GHCi custom key bindings](https://blog.rcook.org/blog/2018/ghci-custom-key-bindings/)

    > I want to bind keyboard shortcuts to GHCi commands. GHCi makes use of the Haskeline package for performing line input. As an example, I'm going to show you how to bind `F7` to the GHCi `:reload` command.

-   [Not-o-matic differentiation](https://ajknapp.github.io/2018/08/14/notomatic-differentiation.html)

    > This summer, I worked on a Google Summer of Code project intended to implement automatic differentiation for Haskell's accelerate vector programming EDSL, using a new method of automatic differentiation.

-   [What I did on my summer vacation](https://typedr.at/posts/what-i-did-on-my-summer-vacation/)

    > This year, I took part in Google Summer of Code, with a project to attempt to finish bringing Cabal;s Nix-style local builds (the `new-` commands, at least for now) up to parity with the old stateful methodology of using `cabal-install`.

-   [Why doesn't GHCi on Windows find my DLL](https://hub.zhox.com/posts/why-doesnt-ghc-on-windows-find-my-dll/)

    > Why is GHCi looking for `my-cool-library.dll` instead of `my-cool-library-7.dll`. You rename the file and things *seem* to work. This is actually quite dangerous and wrong. Unfortunately this is also often suggested as what to do.
