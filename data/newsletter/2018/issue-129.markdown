Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.4.4 released](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/ghc-8.4.4-released)

    > The GHC team is pleased to announce the availability of GHC 8.4.4, a patch-level release in the 8.4 series. This release fixes several bugs present in 8.4.3.

-   [Aelve Guide: Alpha version released](https://forum.aelve.com/t/aelve-guide-alpha-version-released/17)

    > Today we're releasing the first version of Aelve Guide --- an informal wiki for the Haskell ecosystem and community. It's written in Haskell, too.

-   [Haskell's kind system: A primer](https://diogocastro.com/blog/2018/10/17/haskells-kind-system-a-primer/)

    > In this post we'll explore Haskell's kind system, the similarities between types and kinds, and show how these can be leveraged to write safer and more reusable code.

-   [A JavaScript wat and monoidal folds](https://typeclasses.com/javascript/monoidal-folds)

    > We suppose all programming languages have the occasional wat, some function or behavior that is surprising and makes you think, "wait, what?"

-   [An applicative password list](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/10/15/an-applicative-password-list/)

    > How to use the applicative functor capabilities of lists to create a password list, with examples that object-oriented programmers can understand.

-   [Fixpoints in Haskell](https://medium.com/@cdsmithus/fixpoints-in-haskell-294096a9fc10)

    > If you have a function from any set to itself, then a fixpoint of that function is any input that maps to itself.

-   [Haskell by day](https://www.adomokos.com/2018/10/haskell-by-day.html)

    > I have always thought Haskell is this far-out, esoteric, academic language that no one uses.

-   [How to test Servant applications](https://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/testing/Testing.html)

    > In this recipe we'll work through some common testing strategies and provide examples of utilizing these testing strategies in order to test Servant applications.

-   [Practical Haskell programs from scratch: A quick and easy guide](https://www.ahri.net/practical-haskell-programs-from-scratch/)

    > Here, I will supply what I consider to be the fastest way to get up and running with Haskell --- it's opinionated, and I'm sure you'll want to tweak and improve on it as you learn more.

-   [Subvert your type checker today!](https://jship.github.io/posts/2018-10-13-subvert-your-type-checker-today.html)

    > Do you wish you could do IO from any monad transformer stack, including those stacks that do not have IO at the base?
