## Featured

-   [Cellular Christmas tree](https://dodisturb.me/posts/2018-01-28-Cellular-Christmas-Tree.html)

    > In which we create a program displaying a Christmas tree from a single dot on an infinite tape using two cellular automata computed with comonads as used in Haskell. You can also call it yet another comonad tutorial if you like.

-   [Domain modeling with Haskell: Factoring out recursion](https://haskell-at-work.com/episodes/2018-02-11-domain-modelling-with-haskell-factoring-out-recursion.html)

    > In the final part of the "Domain modeling with Haskell" series we factor out recursion from the Project data type, and use Fixplate to traverse the tree and accumulate reports. Although a highly flexible and powerful technique, it should not be employed prematurely due to its more advanced nature.

-   [Existential crisis](https://medium.com/@concertdaw/existential-crisis-366cf6ee426a)

    > I decided to experiment with different ways of storing values with mixed types in the same data structure. This post aims to explain some of the things I found, and should hopefully compliment the good material that others have already published.

-   [Stack patching policy](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/02/stack-patching-policy)

    > What do we do in a situation where an upstream package has a bug, and either cannot (within the timeframe desired) or will not release a new version with a fix?

-   [Day 21: On Haskelling](https://www.dabolivar.com/posts/day-21/)

    > We could use some guidelines when trying to learn something. So here's my very amateurish advice to learning Haskell.

-   [MMark status update](https://markkarpov.com/post/mmark-status-update.html)

    > In November 2017 I announced MMark --- a the strict markdown processor for writers. I worked on it actively for some time since then and this post is a little update about the project, which by the way even has its own GitHub organization now.

-   [Google Summer of Code: Haskell.org](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5706672807346176/)

    > We have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.

-   [How to derive Generic for (some) GADTs using `QuantifiedConstraints`](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2018/02/11/how-to-derive-generic-for-some-gadts/)

    > It turns out that while we won't be able to derive `Generic` for *all* GADTs, we can in fact derive them for a *subset* of them. The trick that makes this possible is `QuantifiedConstraints`, an experimental GHC language feature that hasn't been merged yet.

-   [An opinionated guide to Haskell in 2018](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2018/02/10/an-opinionated-guide-to-haskell-in-2018/)

    > In the interest of both sharing with others the small amount of wisdom I've gained and preserving it for my future self, I've decided to write a long, rather dry overview of a few select parts of the Haskell workflow I developed and the ecosystem I settled into.

-   [Humble Book Bundle: Functional Programming](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/functional-programming-books?partner=haskellweekly)

    > More awesome tech ebooks for you. We've teamed up with O'Reilly for another bundle full of top-quality books! Get titles like Functional Thinking, Clojure Programming, Learning Scala, and Programming Rust. Plus, your purchase will support Code for America!
