Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Eta v0.8: REPL and metaprogramming](https://blog.eta-lang.org/eta-v0-8-repl-and-metaprogramming-12e900ccfe25)

    > This release implements two long-awaited features: (1) Eta REPL: It is based on GHCi and provides a way to interactively write Eta programs using the read-eval-print-loop. (2) Template Metaprogramming: It is based on Template Haskell and allows you to do code generation at compile time similar to macros in Lisp-like languages.

-   [Type classes: Prepare for launch](https://typeclasses.com/news/2018-05-prepare-for-launch)

    > The videos give us a chance to show what happens when you make different kinds of mistakes, but the text is more useful when you want to look back, review, refresh your memory.

-   [Restyled](https://restyled.io)

    > Restyled makes it easy to maintain, or transition to, a consistent coding style across your entire organization by integrating directly into your existing Pull Request process.

-   [Generating art with Haskell](https://paytonturnage.com/writing/2018-06-05-generating-art-with-haskell/)

    > This article is an introduction to writing generative art with Haskell, using a stack inspired by Ben Kovach's similar post I came across in March. I assume familiarity with Haskell and an interest in generative art.

-   [Cofree will tear us apart](https://iokasimov.github.io/posts/2018/05/cofree-will-tear-us-apart)

    > Recently I've been working on distributed systems and I often need to deal with the data that may be located anywhere. We'll see how just one algebraic construction helped to describe a problem with recycling data in general and then to solve it.

-   [Pattern matching ADTs](https://adamschoenemann.dk/posts/2018-05-29-pattern-matching.html)

    > This post is about implementing coverage checking of pattern matches using Haskell. It does not involve any super-advanced type-level trickery, so as long you're somewhat comfortable with monad transformers you should be fine.

-   [Breadth-first traversals in far too much detail](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-06-03-breadth-first-traversals-in-too-much-detail.html)

    > After looking at the algorithms I posted last time, I noticed some patterns emerging which I thought deserved a slightly longer post. I'll go through the problem (Gibbons 2015) in a little more detail, and present some more algorithms to go along with it.

-   [Heterogeneous lists with dependent types in Haskell](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2018-06-06-hlists-dependent-haskell.html)

    > With the help of GHC's many extensions, we can encode simple forms of dependent types, allowing us to enforce more expressive invariants in our programs at compile time.

-   [Research as a build system with Shake](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2018-05-28-research-as-a-build-system)

    > In the last year, I have the opportunity to try out a new way to improve upon my own productivity doing research and other university-related projects. I call it the research build system, and it has allowed me to iterate on my work more quickly.

## Jobs

-   [Software engineer at ITProTV in Gainesville, Florida](https://functionaljobs.com/jobs/9080-software-engineer-developer-at-itprotv)

    > ITPro.TV is a fast-growing digital media business that focuses on continuing education in technical domains. We are currently accepting applications for full-stack software professionals to join our small but talented multidisciplinary team.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [clock](https://www.stackage.org/lts-11.12/package/clock-0.7.2),
a library that provides convenient access to high-resolution clock and timer functions of different operating systems via a unified API.
