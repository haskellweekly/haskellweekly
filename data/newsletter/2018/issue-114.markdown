## Featured

-   [GHC 8.6.1-alpha1 available](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2018-June/015970.html)

    > The GHC development team is pleased to announce the first alpha release leading up to GHC 8.6.1. This is the first release (partially) generated using our new CI infrastructure.

-   [10 Commandments: Compiler in Haskell edition](https://theindigamer.github.io/10-commandments-compiler-in-haskell-edition.html)

    > During the spring semester of 2018, I took a basic compilers course --- our team chose to write the compiler in Haskell. This is a chronicle/post-mortem/random hodgepodge of my thoughts.

-   [Contributing to GHC 4: Real issues](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2018/7/2/contributing-to-ghc-4-real-issues)

    > Last week, we made some more complicated changes. This week, we're going to wrap this series up by looking at some basic ways of making contributions.

-   [Fast Sudoku solver in Haskell: A simple solution](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/fast-sudoku-solver-in-haskell-1/)

    > The aim of this series of posts is to write a fast Sudoku solver in Haskell, so we'll focus on both implementing the solution and making it efficient, step-by-step, starting with a slow but simple solution in this post.

-   [How I finally "cracked the nut"](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/8uzmqt/how_i_finally_cracked_the_nut/)

    > Seven years is how long it has taken me to "get" Haskell. I would like to document and share an overview of my journey in case it helps another frustrated soul.

-   [Keep your laziness in check](http://very.science/pdf/StrictCheck_arxiv.pdf) (pdf)

    > We introduce StrictCheck: a property-based random testing framework for observing, specifying, and testing the strictness of Haskell functions.

-   [Probability 5 ways](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2018-06-30-probability-5-ways.html)

    > Ever since the famous pearl by Erwig and Kollmansberger, probabilistic programming with monads has been an interesting and diverse area in functional programming, with many different approaches. I'm going to present five here, some of which I have not seen before.

-   [Redis data modeling with rank 2 types](https://identicalsnowflake.github.io/Rank2Modeling.html)

    > What if instead of quantifying a type, we instead quantified over things quantifying over a type? This is rank 2 polymorphism. In this article, I want to demonstrate a simple use of rank 2 polymorphism to construct interesting Redis queries.

-   [Stop supporting older GHCs](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/07/stop-supporting-older-ghcs)

    > I recommend cutting out support for older GHCs, updating your cabal files to reflect this decision, and keeping your CI build matrix curated appropriately.
