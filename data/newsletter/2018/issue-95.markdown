Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GSoC 2018 ideas](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html)

    > This is a list of ideas for students who are considering to apply to Google Summer of Code 2018 for Haskell.org.

-   [Haskell Symposium 2018](https://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2018/)

    > The Haskell Symposium aims to present original research on Haskell, discuss practical experience and future development of the language, and to promote other forms of denotative programming.

-   [Haskell ecosystem requests](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/02/haskell-ecosystem-requests)

    > A single comment in a mega-thread on GitHub is hardly a good place to write down these requests, however, and it seems like there's no progress on them. I'm going to instead put down these ideas here, with a bit more explanation, and a few more ideas that have popped up since then.

-   [Atomic expressions generically](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2018/02/atomic-expressions-generically.html)

    > For certain hints HLint needs to determine if a Haskell expression is atomic. I wrote a generic method to generate expressions and test if they are atomic.

-   [Applicative functors for fun and parsing](https://arunraghavan.net/2018/02/applicative-functors-for-fun-and-parsing/)

    > I am very excited by how elegantly Haskell allows us to express these ideas, using fundamental aspects of its type(class) system.

-   [Applicative parsing](https://blog.lahteenmaki.net/applicative-parsing.html)

    > I heard about Applicative Parsing, and learned that even the state of the art monadic parser combinator libraries in Haskell actually come with applicative interfaces. So, what's going on?

-   [Applicative parsing 2: Putting the pieces together](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2018/2/19/applicative-parsing-ii-putting-the-pieces-together)

    > This week, we'll put these pieces together in an actual parser for our Gherkin syntax.

-   [Why are types so cool, Part 1: Result types](https://blue-dinosaur.github.io/haskell/type-theory/programming/2018/02/19/result-types.html)

    > Haskell is denser than Python code, and it is semantically richer. It can convey more precise and richer meanings about what the code does. And Haskell can type-check that code and guarantee that it makes sense. It won't throw exceptions or errors.

-   [ASCII fractals](https://janmasrovira.gitlab.io/ascetic-slug/post/ascii-fractals/)

    > Getting hypnotized by the shape of a fractal is certainly fascinating. In this blog, we will write a Haskell program that creates fractals from a base pattern. The recursive nature of the fractals allow a simple implementation in Haskell.

## Jobs

-   [Developer at Tsuru in Tokyo](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7ysft5/tsuru_is_hiring/duits8s/)

    > Tsuru Capital is hiring, full time and intern positions are available. Haskell knowledge is required, experience with pricing futures/options would be nice but not necessary. Located in Tokyo, company language is English.

-   [Remote devops at FP Complete](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/965969385755172869)

    > We're continuing to expand our devops team at FP Complete. Remote work, awesome team, modern tooling, interesting projects.

## In brief
