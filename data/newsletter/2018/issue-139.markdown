Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [The Essence of Datalog](https://dodisturb.me/posts/2018-12-25-The-Essence-of-Datalog.html) by Mistral Contrastin

    > In which we implement a simple Datalog engine in not many lines of Haskell to understand its semantics.

-   [Welcome to GitLab!](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2018-December/016716.html) by Ben Gamari

    > I am happy to announce that CI on GHC's GitLab instance is now stable. At this point GitLab is to be considered the official upstream repository of GHC.

-   [Stackage LTS 13 with ghc-8.6.3](https://www.stackage.org/blog/2018/12/announce-lts-13) by Dan Burton

    > We are pleased to announce the release of lts-13.0, the first in a new LTS Haskell snapshot series, using ghc-8.6.3.

-   [Abstraction levels in functional programming](https://tzemanovic.gitlab.io/posts/abstraction-levels-in-functional-programming/) by Tomáš Zemanovič

    > I am delighted to see more people learning functional programming and find the effort that goes into making it accessible to a wider audience encouraging.

-   [Advent of Haskell](https://medium.com/@mvaldesdeleon/advent-of-haskell-950d6408a729) by Martín Valdés de León

    > Thoughts and lessons learned after using Haskell consistently for 25 days in a row.

-   [Curses Pac-man game in Haskell](https://github.com/ajkavanagh/pacman/tree/b72468ed0519858288f35f1ae1b2cfb91516df4f) by Alex Kavanagh

    > I wrote this as an exercise in improving my Haskell, which I started this year and for learning how to use lenses for a presentation I'm going to do for my local functional programming group.

-   [Happy Haskell Programming for GHC 8.x](http://haskell.1045720.n5.nabble.com/Happy-Haskell-Programming-for-GHC-8-x-td5888460.html) by Kazu Yamamoto

    > I'm happy to announce that Happy Haskell Programming (HHP) version 0.0.0 has been released. In short, HHP is a fork from ghc-mod 4.1.6 and re-written for all GHC 8.x.

-   [Rigid types and block arguments](https://typeclasses.com/news/2018-12-yearly-billing-regional-discounts) by Chris Martin

    > Rigid type variables: Understanding that phrase that shows up in your compile errors can help you learn more about the type system. BlockArguments: The fun new GHC extension stealing everyone's dollars.

-   [Testing `distributed-process` apps using Hspec](https://filib.io/posts/2018-12-24-testing-distributed-process-apps-with-hspec.html) by Philip Cunningham

    > `distributed-process` is a Haskell library that brings Erlang-style concurrency to Haskell. Whilst developing an application at work that uses it, I found that there wasn't much material online describing how to test `distributed-process` applications.

## Jobs

-   [Galois is Hiring!](https://galois.com/careers/) (ad)

    > Galois is looking for Software Engineers/Researchers and Project Managers! We collaborate with organizations like NASA, DARPA, and Amazon Web Services to explore blue sky ideas and turn them into usable technology. Some of the things we've worked on in the past: Formal methods, static analysis, binary analysis, cryptographic algorithms, domain specific languages, programming languages theory, abstract interpretation, type theory, formal verification and software correctness, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems assurance, communication security, cyber-deception for network defense, DDoS defense, provable hardware security, statistical anomaly detection for detecting advanced persistent threats. We think working here is awesome (see <https://lifeatgalois.com>).
