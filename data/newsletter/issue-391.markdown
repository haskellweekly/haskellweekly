Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Diverk: a Reflex app to browse GitHub repos](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/diverk-a-reflex-app-to-browse-github-repo/7904) by jecaro
  > That’s a super simple app that allows you to browse and search in the default branch of a GitHub repo. It can render markdown files. I’m a big note taker and all the notes I take live in a private git repo in this format. That was an additional motivation for me to do this project.

- [Reason Isomorphically!](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/daniel.james/iso/iso.pdf) by Ralf Hinze, Daniel W. H. James
  > When are two types the same? In this paper we argue that isomorphism is a more useful notion than equality. 

- [Sovereign Tech Fund invests in Cabal as critical Haskell infrastructure](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/10/sovereign-tech-fund-invests-in-cabal/) by Well-Typed
  > We are delighted to announce that the Sovereign Tech Fund is investing in the development and maintenance of Cabal, the Haskell build system, following a proposal Well-Typed submitted to the “Improve FOSS Developer Tooling” challenge.
  
- [SQLiteDAV - A WebDAV Server for SQLite Databases](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/sqlitedav-a-webdav-server-for-sqlite-databases/7908) by Adrian Sieber
  > SQLiteDAV allows you to access your SQLite databases over the WebDAV protocol by mapping tables, rows, and columns to files and folders.
  
- [The Haskell Unfolder Episode 13: open recursion](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2023/10/haskell-unfolder-episode-13-open-recursion/) by Andres Löh, Edsko de Vries
  > Open recursion is a technique for defining objects in Haskell whose behaviour can be adjusted after they have been defined. It can be used to do some form of object-oriented programming in Haskell, and is also an interesting technique in its own right.

## Jobs

- [Haskell Tech Lead (fully remote)](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-tech-lead-fully-remote/7932) by Serokell
  > We’re seeking an experienced Software Engineer to supervise a team of software engineers. Our work is not limited to Haskell development, so you’ll also be involved in overseeing other exciting areas such as research, frontend, and packaging.

## In brief

- [Best way/resource to learn Haskell with a week to spare](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/17bneno/best_wayresource_to_learn_haskell_with_a_week_to/) by unlikelytom
  > So I'll be joining a company in 10 days that primarily uses Haskell. I want to be better prepared when I join.

## Show & tell

- [DevOps Weekly Log, 2023-10-29](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/devops-weekly-log-2023-10-29/7945) by Bryan Richter
  > The short version is that I am working on migrating Stackage to Haskell Foundation maintainership. I’ve started with the Stackage builder, which tests that everything in a snapshot can be built together, and then I’ll move on to other pieces like Stackage.org and the public casa server.

## Call for participation

- [Opportunity for improving GHC: fixing some spurious failures in CI](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/opportunity-for-improving-ghc-fixing-some-spurious-failures-in-ci/7903) by Bryan Richter
  > I was asked about spurious failures in GHC CI, and figured the answer was worth a public post. There are three frequent causes of spurious failure that someone with a bit of experience could take a look at. I would be happy to assist.

- [haskell-language-server: Use cabal-add to fill missing build-depends automatically](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/3853)
