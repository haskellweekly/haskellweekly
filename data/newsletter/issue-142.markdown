Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Real World Halogen](https://thomashoneyman.com/guides/real-world-halogen/) by Thomas Honeyman

    > This guide demonstrates how to build a real world single-page application in PureScript and its most popular framework, Halogen. It comes with over 2,000 lines of commented code so you can see exactly how the ideas presented here translate to idiomatic PureScript.

-   [f(by) 2019 conference](https://fby.by)

    > If you are in Eastern Europe, do not miss 5th annual f(by) conference on January 26 in Minsk. This year Haskell talks are given by Vitaly Bragilevskyi, Christoph Hegemann, Andrew Lelechenko. In addition the keynote by Venkat Subramaniam, and many other FP talks. Belarus is visa free for 87 countries. If you cannot make it to Belarus, submit your email to get videos, which are free.

-   [A Binomial Urn](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2019-01-15-binomial-urn.html) by Donnacha Oisín Kidney

    > I've gotten huge mileage out of this fold and the general ideas about it, and today I'm going to show one more use of it.

-   [Cursors, Part 3: The Nonempty List Cursor](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2019-01-14-cursors-nonempty-list) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove

    > If a list is guaranteed to not be empty, then we can take advantage of this invariant to make a cursor that looks at an element, instead of between two elements.

-   [Dhall - Year in review (2018-2019)](http://www.haskellforall.com/2019/01/dhall-year-in-review-2018-2019.html) by Gabriel Gonzalez

    > The Dhall configuration language is now two years old and this post will review progress in 2018 and the future direction of the language in 2019.

-   [Dynamic Graphs: A Haskell library for the dynamic connectivity problem](https://jaspervdj.be/posts/2019-01-11-dynamic-graphs.html) by Jasper Van der Jeugt

    > Alex Lang and I recently "finished" a library for dealing with dynamic graphs. The library focuses on the dynamic connectivity problem in particular, although it can do some other things as well.

-   [Fast file embedding with GHC!](https://hsyl20.fr/home/posts/2019-01-15-fast-file-embedding-with-ghc.html) by Sylvain Henry

    > If like me you sometimes want to embed resources files into executable binaries generated by GHC, you may have already used file-embed package. The problem is: compile time and memory usage are awful for "big" files, where "big" = a few megabytes.

-   [Haskell showroom: How to switch between multiple Kubernetes clusters and namespaces](https://denibertovic.com/posts/haskell-showroom-how-to-switch-between-kubernetes-clusters/) by Deni Bertović

    > This series of posts titled "Haskell Showroom" are my attempt at showcasing what Haskell can be used for. It's an attempt to answer the question I get asked a lot: "What is Haskell a good fit for?"

-   [Hindsight on Advent of Code 2018](https://phaazon.net/blog/aoc-18-hindsight) by Dimitri Sabadie

    > This blog post sums up what I did with AoC#18, my thoughts about the puzzles and even a meta-discussion about programming challenges. I used Haskell for most challenges and switched to Rust for no specific reason. Just fun.

-   [Teaching to read Haskell](http://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/750-Teaching_to_read_Haskell) by Joachim Breitner

    > Instead of young students with fairly little computer scientist background who can spent quite a bit of time to learn to write Haskell, I am now addressing senior and very smart computer scientists with many other important things to do, who want to learn to read Haskell.

## Jobs
