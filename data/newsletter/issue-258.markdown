Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 9.2.1-alpha1 now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-2-1-alpha1-now-available/2286?u=taylorfausak) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC developers are very happy to announce the availability of the first alpha release in the 9.2.1 series.

- [Too Much Power Will Kill You (Every Time)](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/2021/04/03/too-much-power-will-kill-you/) by Marko Dimjašević
  > Today there is a bug, and you won't understand why, you'd give your life, you'd sell your soul, but here it comes again, too much power will kill you every time.

- [Category Theory Illustrated: Orders](https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/04_order/) by Boris Marinov
  > As mathematicians we are not interested in the criteria that we can use to order objects, but in the nature of the relationship that defines the order.

- [Custom Type Errors for Unordered Function Application](https://mgsloan.com/posts/unordered-apply-type-errors/) by Michael Sloan
  > In the previous post, a combination of a typeclass, closed type family, and associated type family was used to define an operator, `(?)`. This operator provides type-directed function application, where the argument is provided to the first parameter that has a matching type.

- [Default exception handler in Haskell](https://taylor.fausak.me/2021/04/03/default-exception-handler-in-haskell/) by Taylor Fausak
  > This post will explain why you might want a default exception handler, how to install one, and point out a tricky edge case to watch out for.

- [Why kind-level `forall`s don't interact with `ScopedTypeVariables`](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2021/04/05/why-kind-level-foralls-dont-interact-with-scopedtypevariables/) by Ryan Scott
  > In this post, I will explain this discrepancy between kind-level `forall`s and other forms of `forall`. As it turns out, a key part of the story is that certain type-level declarations, such as type synonyms and type families, have arities.

- [Z.Haskell project announced](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/z-haskell-project-announced/2332?u=taylorfausak) by Dong Han
  > After having a discussion with HF guys, I decide to announce Z.Haskell project, It's available on Hackage and very much usable now, the document is also pretty adequate.

## In brief

- [The Benefits of Learning Haskell](https://alistairb.dev/benefits-of-learning-haskell/) by Alistair Burrowes
  > My belief is that in terms of long term improvement, learning Haskell is one of the best ways to up your raw programming ability.

- [Capturing Number Theory in Haskell](https://bor0.wordpress.com/2021/04/05/capturing-number-theory-in-haskell/) by Boro Sitnikovski
  > In Chapter VII of GEB, the author gives a description of Gentzen's Propositional Calculus, along with some examples of applying its rules, and in Chapter VIII, the author gives a description of TNT (Typographical Number Theory).

- [Compucolor II: A 1977 Home Computer recreated in Clash](https://github.com/gergoerdi/clash-compucolor2/tree/2d223b632212868b52fde024e9425da595c57ea8) by Gergő Érdi
  > This is a Clash implementation of the 1977 Compucolor II home computer manifactured by the CompuColor Corporation until 1980.

- [Giml's type inference engine](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2021/04/06/giml-type-inference) by Gil Mizrahi
  > Giml's type inference engine uses unification-based constraint solving.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (April 2021)](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/mj7kv5/monthly_hask_anything_april_2021/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

- [Splitting function definitions across modules](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/splitting-function-definitions-across-modules/2327?u=taylorfausak) by Jaro Reinders
  > Have you ever been annoyed that you have to define your functions all at once? Me neither, but nevertheless, I have been thinking about a way of solving this issue with Template Haskell.

## Show & tell

- [alpaca-netcode](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/alpaca-netcode-0.1.0.0) by David Eichmann
  > A rollback/replay client-server system for realtime multiplayer games. The API only requires you to express your game as a pure, deterministic function.
