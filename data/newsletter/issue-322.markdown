- [Deploying an IHP project to Fly.io](https://nathanjaremko.com/deploying-an-ihp-project-to-flyio/) by Nathan Jaremko
  > Learning Haskell the conventional way can be difficult, so I'm going to recommend a different path, you can dive in head-first with the "Ruby on Rails" of Haskell: IHP.

- [GHC Activities report: April--May 2022](https://well-typed.com/blog/2022/06/ghc-2022-04-2022-05/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the twelth edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed.

- [Incremental Builds for Haskell with Bazel](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-06-23-haskell-module/) by Facundo Domínguez
  > In this post we describe `haskell_module`, a new rule in `rules_haskell`, which allows to express the dependencies between modules.

- [GHC 9.4.1-alpha3 now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-4-1-alpha3-now-available/4701?u=taylorfausak) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of the thirdalpha release of the GHC 9.4 series.

- [Haskell in Production: Channable](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production-channable) by Gints Dreimanis
  > Our today's guest is Fabian Thorand, who is a team lead at Channable. Read further to learn where Channable uses Haskell, why they chose it, and what they like and don't like about it.

- [Using a 50-years old technique for solving modern issues](https://kodimensional.dev/cps) by Dmirtrii Kovanikov
  > The described technique uses the CPS transformation and Haskell layout parsing rules. It sounds scary but in its core it's just a refactoring using Higher-Order Functions, no fancy features involved.
