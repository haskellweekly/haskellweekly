Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haskell in Production: RELEX Solutions](https://serokell.io/blog/relex-solutions-interview) by Gints Dreimanis
  > In this edition of our Haskell in Production series, we sit down with RELEX Solutions, a supply chain & retail planning platform. In this interview with Serokell, Lead Software Developers, Mats Rauhala and Martin Potier, shared with us their reasons for choosing Haskell for their project and their experience implementing it.

- [Integrating a large Tokio-based Rust library with Haskell](https://www.iankduncan.com/articles/2023-08-30-integrating-haskell-and-tokio) by Ian Duncan
  > One of the hallmarks of Rust is its relative ease of interoperability with other languages. Python, Ruby, and Node.js all have fairly robust interoperability bridges with Rust. Haskell, on the other hand, currently has a fairly limited set of options for complex integration.

- [Laziness in Haskell — Part 4: Thunks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC9cpQk7WWA) by Alexis King
  > It is finally time to take a look at how GHC introduces thunks to implement laziness. We first consider ways that thunking can sometimes be viewed as an optimization, then try to understand the source of unnecessary thunking in most Haskell programs.

- [Outlawing return types in Servant APIs](https://jship.github.io/posts/2023-09-04-servant-outlawed-return-types/) by Jason Shipman
  > This post demonstrates how to outlaw specific return types from servant APIs. Perhaps we have types that are intended for backend use only, or maybe the types are legal in one API but illegal in another yet the backend code is a monolith. 
  
- [Seeking a new director for the Haskell Foundation](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/seeking-a-new-director-for-the-haskell-foundation/7497) by Richard Eisenberg
  > With @david-christiansen’s departure coming up in about a month, the Haskell Foundation is now seeking a new Executive Director.
  
- [Simon Peyton Jones: In Pursuit of Simplicity](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/simon-peyton-jones-in-pursuit-of-simplicity/id1554305438?i=1000626231690) by Danielle Newnham Podcast
  > Haskell creator Simon Peyton Jones on his life and work.
  
- [Well Typed collaborates with the Haskell Community to support HLS development](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/09/hls-work/) by Zubin Duggal
  > Well-Typed has been collaborating with the Haskell Language Server (HLS) development team thanks to funding from Mercury, Hasura and the HLS Open Collective to support HLS development.

## In brief

- [Cryptography Community Project: Leg 1 Proposal Draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/16br970/cryptography_community_project_leg_1_proposal/) by ApothecaLabs
  > Today I am happy to announce that the first draft of the Cryptography Community Project Proposal has been finished, and it explains in much greater detail what this effort is about. Before I submit it officially, I would like to ask the community for feedback.
  
- [Feedback wanted: JSON diagnostics output for GHC](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/feedback-wanted-json-diagnostics-output-for-ghc/7531) by Hécate Moonlight
  > @benbellick is authoring a merge request that aims to make the JSON format of GHC diagnostics more useful.

- [Jacinda 2.0.0.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-jacinda-2-0-0-0/7516) by Vanessa McHale
  > I have released another iteration of Jacinda, a text-processing language that lets you filter (fits in with sed + awk), handy on Unix!
  
- [Learn Physics with Functional Programming](https://nostarch.com/learn-physics-functional-programming) by Scott N. Walck
  > A Hands-on Guide to Exploring Physics with Haskell.

- [Tasty-1.5 release candidate](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/tasty-1-5-release-candidate/7496) by Bodigrim
  > On behalf of maintainers I’m happy to announce tasty-1.5 RC1.
