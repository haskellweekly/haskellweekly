Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Abusing Constraints for Automatic Documentation](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/abusing-constraints/index.html) by Sandy Maguire
  > Determining this by hand is tedious and error-prone, and worse, doesn't stay up to date with code changes. Instead, let's see how we can use the type system to eliminate the pain.

- [Binary search over floating point representations](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2023/01/02/binary-search-over-floating-point-representations/) by Brent Yorgey
  > I got some good feedback on my last post about binary search, and thought it was worth a follow-up post.

- [From delimited continuations to algebraic effects in Haskell](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2023-01-02-del-cont-examples.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > The upcoming version of GHC will feature primitives for delimited continuations. Let's put them to use and build a bare bones algebraic effect system.

- [Monthly Update On A Haskell Game Engine](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/monthly-update-on-a-haskell-game-engine/5515?u=taylorfausak) by Rodrigo Mesquita
  > Hey all, I've been working the past month or two in a game engine (called Ghengin).

- [Optimising Haskell, example 2](https://work.njae.me.uk/2023/01/02/optimising-haskell-example-2/) by Neil Smith
  > The day 23 solution takes too long (around seven minutes on my machine) so this post shows how a different representation can make a big difference in performance.

- [Parallel streaming in Haskell: Part 1 - Fast, efficient, and fun!](https://www.channable.com/tech/parallel-streaming-in-haskell-part-1-fast-efficient-fun) by Channable
  > This post explains how we parallelized our system without incurring any significant overhead costs, allowing us to linearly speed-up our workloads with the number of cores available.

- [Seven GUIs in reflex-vty, Part 2: The Temperature Converter](https://blog.obsidian.systems/seven-guis-in-reflex-vty-part-2-the-temperature-converter/) by Obsidian Systems
  > We're going to implement the 7GUIs in Haskell using the reflex functional reactive programming framework.
