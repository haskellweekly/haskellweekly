Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Building real-world Haskell applications using Tagless-Final and ReaderT](https://fpunfold.com/2023/01/30/final-tagless-readert.html) by Amogh Rathore
  > I have been learning and playing with Haskell on-and-off for a couple of years now. However, I was still not very confident that I could write a real-world application in it.

- [Interface Files with Core Definitions](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/02/interface-files-with-core/) by Matthew Pickering
  > In this post, I will explain a new feature which allows GHC to store the Core definitions of entire modules in interface files.

- [Monad Transformer Compatibility](https://felixspringer.xyz/homepage/blog/monadTransformerCompatibility) by Felix Springer
  > A monad transformer stack will provide access to many monad type classes. But you have to be careful, which transformers can be stacked.

- [Optimizing Haskell Code for Runtime Verification](https://serokell.io/blog/optimizing-k-framework) by Constantine Ter-Matevosian & Sergey Gulin
  > The collaboration involved work on making optimizations to K, a rewrite-based executable semantic framework in which programming languages, type systems, and formal analysis tools can be defined with the help of configurations and rewrite rules.

- [Platonic Hask overview: representable functors and monoidal category structures](https://viviag.io/blog/platonic-hask-overview-monoidal-category-structure) by Vitalii Guzeev
  > We have constructed the category of restricted Haskell types. There is nothing particularly useful in this construction yet. We need additional structure and we add it post by post.

- [Squeezing a Sokoban game into 10 lines of code](https://www.cole-k.com/2023/02/21/tiny-games-hs/) by Cole Kurashige
  > Although code golfing is an ultimately frivilous endeavor, I had a lot of fun trying to fit as much as I could into my game and I'm pleased with how it turned out.

- [Understanding horizon Haskell (part 1)](https://homotopic.tech/post/horizon-tutorial-part-1.html) by Dan Firth
  > This is the first in a series of blog posts on horizon haskell. In this first post, we're going to explain what Horizon is, what problem it solves, and how to get set up using one of the open source package sets.

- [Haskell "Not as Scary as You Think"](https://pod.link/1531666706/episode/710a605d605fda251f2e83b8858615b8) by Happy Path Programming
  > We learn the motivations behind Haskell and why it is the pinnacle of Functional Programming from Kris Jenkins, a Developer Advocate at Confluent.

- [Hot swapping state machines](https://github.com/stevana/hot-swapping-state-machines/tree/1f7ae8ff180f99dac3e8ffaa2ce21d5b18273990#hot-swapping-state-machines) by Stevan Andjelkovic
  > An experiment in implementing remote hot code swapping, or dynamic code upgrade, for state machines.

- [Pushing our Container to AWS ECR](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2023/2/20/pushing-our-container-to-aws-ecr) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In this article I'm going to be as explicit as possible, and include a video at the end so you can follow along.

## Show & tell
