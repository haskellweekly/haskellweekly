Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Creating a macOS app with Haskell and Swift](https://alt-romes.github.io/posts/2023-11-10-creating-a-macos-app-with-haskell-and-swift.html) by Rodrigo Mequita
  > First part of an in-depth guide into developing a native macOS application using Haskell with Swift and SwiftUI. This part covers the set-up required to call Haskell functions from Swift in an XCode project using SwiftUI.
  
- [Introducing Updo](https://blockscope.com/posts/2023-11-29-updo-steps.html) by Phil de Joux
  > How to introduce Updo to a project using Cabal as an example.
  
- [MicroHaskell (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk5SJ79nOnA) by Lennart Augustsson
  > MicroHs is an implementation of a subset Haskell that is using combinators; pretty much as described in David Turner's 1979 paper A New Implementation Technique for Applicative Languages. The implementation has very few dependencies, and the binaries can run on almost anything that has a C compiler. The talk will illustrate a few aspects of compiling to combinators.
  
- [RealWorld example app impl w/ Scotty + Esqueleto](https://github.com/toptobes/realworld-scotty-hs) by toptobes
  > This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Haskell/Scotty including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

- [Request for feedback: Haskell implementation of series, or labeled arrays](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/request-for-feedback-haskell-implementation-of-series-or-labeled-arrays/8193) by Laurent P. René de Cotret
  > At work, we have needed a data structure for time-series – think pandas `Series` but for Haskell. I have developed the package `javelin` for this purpose. Before I upload it to Hackage (and start following the package versioning policy), I would like to know what the community thinks of it.

- [Web-View Initial Release: Type-safe HTML and CSS](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-web-view-initial-release-type-safe-html-and-css/8222) by Sean Hess
  > `web-view` is a library for type-safe HTML and CSS with intuitive layouts and composable styles. This is an idea I’ve been experimenting with for a few years, and I’m happy to finally release it!

## Jobs

<!-- Runs from 2023-11-30 to 2023-12-07. -->
- [VP of Engineering at Channable (Utrecht, NL)](https://jobs.channable.com/o/vp-of-engineering) (ad)
  > We are looking to hire our first VP of Engineering!
  
  > In this role, you will be responsible for managing our Engineering teams (both Haskell and Python) and enabling them to succeed.
  
  > You will shape our processes and improve them to foster a strong and innovative engineering culture. You will work closely together with Robert (our CTO) on our technical roadmap and strategy, and make sure that it is executed on time and within budget.
  
  > You can independently manage the teams, and make sure that our day-to-day operations are running smoothly.

- [New editor of Haskell Weekly newsletter](https://taylor.fausak.me/2023/11/26/haskell-weekly-editor/) by Taylor Fausak
  > More than seven years ago, I started a newsletter called Haskell Weekly. Since then I’ve edited nearly every issue, with the odd exception for vacations and such. I’m happy to announce that as of three months ago, Alexey Zabelin has taken over as the editor of the Haskell Weekly newsletter.
  
- [SimpleX Chat v5.4 is released](https://simplex.chat/blog/20231125-simplex-chat-v5-4-link-mobile-desktop-quantum-resistant-better-groups.html) by SimpleX

## Show & tell

- [I made a simple template for solving Advent of Code in Haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1868lqj/i_made_a_simple_template_for_solving_advent_of/) by Martin Šošić
  > Hey all, at my alma mater we are holding a course on Haskell for the students, and one of the initiatives as part of that course is that students can optionally participate in solving Advent Of Code in Haskell. In order to make it easier for them to get going with it, and to save them from pitfalls of setting up a project in Cabal, I created this template github repo.
