Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Summer of Haskell 2023](https://summer.haskell.org/)
  > We are pleased to announce that Haskell.Org in collaboration with the Haskell Foundation will be hosting the Summer of Haskell 2023! This program will be occurring independently from Google Summer of Code but offers the same opportunities, including mentorship and a stipend, to would-be Haskell contributors.

- [Algebraic Path Finding](https://iagoleal.com/posts/algebraic-path/) by Iago Leal de Freitas
  > There's something magical about polymorphic algorithms. Really, isn't it awesome to write a piece of code once and then just tweak the meaning of some inputs to solve another seemly unrelated problem?

- [Cabal, tree-sitter, and consult](https://magnus.therning.org/2023-03-27-cabal,-tree-sitter,-and-consult.html) by Magnus Therning
  > After my last post I thought I'd move on to implement the rest of the functions in haskell-mode's major mode for Cabal, functions like `haskell-cabal-goto-library-section` and `haskell-cabal-goto-executable-section`.

- [Calling Purgatory from Heaven: Binding to Rust in Haskell](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/03/purgatory/) by Edsho de Vries
  > In this blog post, we will consider how to call functions written in Rust instead: not quite hell, but not quite heaven either.

- [Copilot + Static Typing = &lt;3](https://blog.textql.com/copilot--static-typing-3/)
  > To my surprise, it's been a good experience, despite Haskell not being one of Copilot's officially supported languages.

- [Debunking Haskell Myths and Stereotypes](https://dev.to/zelenya/debunking-haskell-myths-and-stereotypes-1e04) by Zelenya
  > Haskell is covered with myths and stereotypes, such as "You need a Ph.D. to do Haskell" or "Haskell is only good for writing compilers". These are silly and not true.

- [Developing network related libraries in Haskell in 2022FY](https://kazu-yamamoto.hatenablog.jp/entry/2023/03/23/134317) by Kazu Yamamoto
  > This article is my annual report of 2022FY(fiscal year in Japan; from April 2022 to March 2023). My mission in IIJ is contribute to standardizations of new network protocols by their implementations.

- [Linear Constraints: the problem with scopes](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-03-23-linear-constraints-linearly/) by Arnaud Spiwack
  > This is the second of two companion blog posts to the paper Linearly Qualified Types, published at ICFP 2021 (there is also a long version, with appendices).

## In brief

- [Agda Implementors' Meeting XXXVI](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Main/AIMXXXVI) by Bohdan Liesnikov
  > The thirty-sixth Agda Implementors' Meeting will take place in Delft, NL from Wednesday, 2023-05-10 to Tuesday, 2023-05-16. The meeting aims to bring together people not only developing but also using Agda. We will have talks on the implementation details of Agda in the morning and code sprints in the afternoon. There's a (soft) deadline for registration on 2023-04-12.

- [An apologia of lazy evaluation](https://epicandmonicisnotiso.blogspot.com/2023/03/an-apologia-of-lazy-evaluation.html) by Ruben Astudillo
  > It is not my intention straw man my way on apologetics. But before discussing these points we need to talk about value systems.

- [CLC: Status of **ALL** proposals](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/clc-status-of-all-proposals/6049?u=taylorfausak) by Dmitrii Kovanikov
  > A couple of weeks ago, I started the initiative to track the progress of all approved proposals in the new CLC process, and I'd like to share the final results.

  > This is one of the biggest releases of Ogma ever: We can now generate monitors for FPrime, a component-based flight software framework used in many NASA missions, including the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.

- [New Free Course: Setup.hs!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2023/3/27/new-free-course-setuphs) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > You can read all the Haskell articles you want, but unless you write the code for yourself, you'll never get anywhere! But there are so many different tools and ideas floating around out there, so how are you supposed to know what to do?
