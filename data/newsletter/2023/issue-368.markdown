Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Bound by a Free-Monad-like Structure](https://functor.tokyo/blog/2023-05-11-bound) by Dennis Gosnell
  > This post explains a little background for `bound`, and then shows my own definition using the free-monad-like structure.

- [Learn Contravariant in 5 minutes](https://jship.github.io/posts/2023-05-11-learn-contravariant-in-five-minutes/) by Jason Shipman
  > There is another "mapping" typeclass out there - `Contravariant` - that we likely don't bump into as often as `Functor`.

- [Summer of Haskell 2023 Project Selections](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2023-05-14-summer-of-haskell-2023-project-selections.html) by Aaron Allen
  > Summer of Haskell 2023 is off to a great start and we have some exciting news to share! We received many quality proposals from which to choose and our mentors have made their selections.

- [Tidal 2.0 beatMode (TidalCycles vs TidalBeats?)](https://slab.org/2023/05/13/tidal-2-0-beatmode-tidalcycles-vs-tidalbeats/) by Alex McLean
  > I've been rewriting Tidal again for a while but resisting actually using it, mostly out of a weird sense of delayed gratification.

- [Working with Haskell CallStack](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2023/05/11/working_with_haskell_callstack.html) by Matt Parsons
  > GHC Haskell provides a type `CallStack` with some magic built in properties. Notably, there's a constraint you can write - `HasCallStack` - that GHC will automagically figure out for you.
