Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Adopting Haskell into an Existing Codebase](https://fossa.com/blog/fossa-podcast-adopting-haskell/) by The FOSSA Podcast
  > In this episode, we'll explain why we adopted Haskell, characteristics of the language, and pros and cons for teams considering it.

- [Fault-injection](https://github.com/stevana/property-based-testing-stateful-systems-tutorial/blob/921d7cb02735e006d9071c1c5b859f5a921e2427/docs/Part04FaultInjection.md) by Stevan Andjelkovic
  > So in this part we will have a look at how we can inject faults in order to try to get a better coverage in this area.

- [GHC 9.6 Migration Guide](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-6-migration-guide/5730?u=taylorfausak) by Ben Gamari
  > Today we are happy to share the migration guide for GHC 9.6. Our hope is that this guide serves as a useful resource for those porting their projects to GHC 9.6.

- [Haskell is not category theory](https://pema.dev/2023/02/01/haskell-not-ct/) by Pema Malling
  > There is some truth to this, but I think it is more accurate to say that certain abstractions in Haskell are inspired by category theory.

- [Haskell Tiny Game Jam!](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-tiny-game-jam/5754?u=taylorfausak) by Simon Michael
  > The first Haskell Tiny Game Jam is now open! All welcome! Your mission: make Haskell games in 10 lines.

- [Logging with class](https://magnus.therning.org/2023-02-08-logging-with-class.html) by Magnus Therning
  > This post wraps up this particular topic for now with a couple of typeclasses, a default implementation, and an example showing how I use them.

- [Mac Notarization (and GHC)](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/mac-notarization-and-ghc/5722?u=taylorfausak) by Bryan Richter
  > I spent a month looking into notarizing GHC for Macs. Although GHC still won't be notarized for 9.6 --- more on that later --- I did learn a lot about it, and I'd like to share that knowledge for posterity.

## Show & tell

- [ghc-syntax-highlighter-themed](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/10sfnfm/rfc_ghcsyntaxhighlighterthemed/) by Brandon Chinn
  > I just learned about ghc-syntax-highlighter and thought it'd be cool to render HTML compatible with any theme provided by highlight.js or Prism.

- [IHP version 1.0.1](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v1.0.1) by Marc Scholten
  > A new IHP release, containing mostly bug fixes and small improvements to existing features.

- [lawful-classes](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/lawful-classes/5729?u=taylorfausak) by Nicolas Trangez
  > Luckily, we can get pretty far with pure `base` types and functions, which is what the `lawful-classes` packages bring: a way to define laws using nothing but base, and then validate instances against such sets of laws using Hedgehog or QuickCheck in a Tasty environment.

- [nng](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/10sr50m/ann_nng_bindings_for_nng_httpsgithubcomnanomsgnng/) by Ricardo Catalinas JimÃ©nez
  > I put together quickly a binding to the NNG library, it's simply a fork of the existing binding to Nanomsg updated to work with NNG using the "compatible API" plus some bug fixes.

- [Yampa version 0.14.1](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/10vx1of/ann_yampa_0141/) by Ivan Perez
