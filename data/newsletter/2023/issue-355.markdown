Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [A concise introduction to `generics-sop`](https://srid.ca/generics-sop-intro) by Sridhar Ratnakumar
  > Non-trivial generic programming is much [simpler](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/) with `generics-sop` than GHC Generics. This post gives an introduction to the `generics-sop` library.

- [The hakyll-nix-template Tutorial](https://robertwpearce.com/the-hakyll-nix-template-tutorial.html) by Robert Pearce

- [guardian: A dependency boundary guardian for your Haskell monorepo](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-guardian-0-4-0-0-a-dependency-boundary-guardian-for-your-haskell-monorepo-to-keep-dependency-sane-and-clean/5800?u=taylorfausak) by Hiromi Ishii
  > It is our great pleasure to announce the first OSS release of guardian, a dependency boundary constraint checker for Haskell monorepo!

- [Implementing Co, a Small Language With Coroutines #3: Adding Coroutines](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/implementing-co-3/) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > In this post, we explore and implement what makes Co really interesting: support for lightweight concurrency using Coroutines.

- [`smtlib-backends`: Faster SMT-LIB-based Haskell interface to SMT solvers](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-02-14-smtlib-backends/) by Quentin Aristote
  > I'll review the pros and cons of different methods for interacting with SMT solvers, before introducing `smtlib-backends` and showing how it can improve these interactions for Haskell programmers.

- [Two kinds of Prisms](https://www.brunogavranovic.com/posts/2023-02-12-two-kinds-of-prisms.html) by Bruno Gavranović
  > While lenses are pretty extensively written about, prisms are more mysterious. What does a prism do? What does it mean to be dual to a lens?

- [Update on The Haskell Guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/112h810/update_on_the_haskell_guide/) by Reuben
  > The goal of this project is to make it as easy as possible for someone with a light coding background to pick up the core ideas of Haskell quickly.
