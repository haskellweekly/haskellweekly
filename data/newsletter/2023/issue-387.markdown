Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Charting a course toward a stable API for GHC](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/charting-a-course-toward-a-stable-api-for-ghc/7646) by Alexis King
  > Our plan of attack is to start small. We cannot hope to address all the complex needs of, say, typechecker plugins or HLS right out of the gate, but we believe we can provide real, immediate utility to many existing tools. 

- [Defeating Return Type Polymorphism](https://philipphagenlocher.de/post/defeating-return-type-polymorphism/) by Philipp Hagenlocher
  > This post is an exploration of a generic technique to effectively circumvent return type polymorphism in Haskell programs using GADTs and existential quantification.
  
- [Finishing up my last work day at the Haskell Foundation](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/finishing-up-my-last-work-day-at-the-hf/7660) by David Thrane Christiansen
  > I thought I’d take a moment to reflect on what we’ve done during my time at the HF, and sketch out the next couple of months.
  
- [GHC 9.6.3 is now released](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-6-3-is-now-released/7682) by Bryan Richter
  > The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.3. 
  
- [Introducing NeoHaskell: A beacon of joy in a greyed tech world](https://dev.to/neohaskell/introducing-neohaskell-a-beacon-of-joy-in-a-greyed-tech-world-4f9b) by Nick Tchayka
  > Through this initiative, I aspire to develop an optimal programming language and ecosystem that eradicates accidental complexity, either in mental form, or in code form.

- [Using Amazonka 2.0](https://tech.freckle.com/2023/09/22/using-amazonka-2-0/) by Freckle
  > The culture at Freckle is one of strong conventions applied uniformly to cut out noise and uncertainty and streamline development. Amazonka’s newfound consistency has reinforced our own strong opinions about how to best use the library, which we’ll describe in this post in the hopes they prove useful to others.

## In brief

- [Haskell Foundation September 2023 Update](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-september-2023-update/7654) by David Thrane Christiansen

- [New co-maintainer for `scotty` and a path towards v1.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/new-co-maintainer-for-scotty-and-a-path-towards-v1-0/7673) by ocramz
  > If you’re anyhow interested in web services, I’m sure you’ve heard of scotty; I’ve been using it extensively in the past years and recently joined scotty-web on Github to help out with maintenance.
  
- [SimpleX Chat v5.3 released: desktop app, local file encryption and improved groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/16ryvz3/simplex_chat_the_private_messenger_without_any/) by SimpleX
  > Desktop apps are compiled with GHC 9.6.2, mobile apps still use 8.10.7 for now.

## Show & tell

  > I’m happy to announce the first good release of Purview. By good I mean I found myself having a good bit of fun writing a website with it.
  
- [VS Code extension for “go to definition” (including non-locals, i.e. dependencies)](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/vs-code-extension-for-go-to-definition-including-non-locals-i-e-dependencies/7680) by Dmitry Baynak
  > I’d like to introduce a new VS Code extension I’ve been working on that implements the go-to (non-local) definition command for Haskell code.
