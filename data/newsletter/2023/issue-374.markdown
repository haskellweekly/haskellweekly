Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

  > In this post we present a specific improvement that I integrated recently, which cuts down the maintenance cost to use LH when introducing assumptions about functions coming from large or multiple packages.

- [Bringing Fun into FP: Interview with Impure Pics](https://serokell.io/blog/interview-with-impure-pics) by Denis Oleynikov
  > In this article, we interview Jay, the mastermind behind Impure Pics. If you have been on Haskell Twitter for a while, you've definitely seen some of his drawings.

- [GHC activities report: April--May 2023](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/06/ghc-activities-report-april-may-2023/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the eighteenth edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed.

- [Haskell: How a Lazy Language Was Put to Work (Part Three)](https://blog.obsidian.systems/haskell-how-a-lazy-language-was-put-to-work-part-three/) by Obsidian Systems
  > The history of Haskell dates back to the mid-eighties when there was a growing interest in lazy functional languages. At that time, a research committee was diligently working on designing a language suitable for teaching, research, and application development, as well as constructing large systems.

- [Haskell: Sourced Recursion Schemes](https://apotheca.io/articles/Sourced-Recursion-Schemes.html) by Leo Dillinger
  > This is the third article in a series about recursion, focused on developing the birecursion-schemes library, although it is starting to grow beyond that scope.

- [ICFP Pearl preprint on rec-def](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/805-ICFP_Pearl_preprint_on_rec-def) by Joachim Breitner
  > It is about the idea of using Haskell's inherent ability to define recursive equations, and use them for more than just functions and lazy data structures.

- [LTS 21 release for ghc-9.4 and Nightly now on ghc-9.6](https://www.stackage.org/blog/2023/06/announce-lts-21-nightly-ghc9.6) by Jens Petersen & Andreas Ländle
  > The Stackage team is very happy to announce the first Stackage LTS version 21 snapshot has been released this week, based on GHC stable version 9.4.5.

- [Monadic lenses are the optic for right monad modules III](https://julesh.com/2023/06/28/monadic-lenses-are-the-optic-for-right-monad-modules-iii/) by Jules Hedges
  > If we'd like both our forwards and backwards passes to live in our monad then this is the simplest case that there is no possible concrete description, without using any quantification.

- [r/haskell will remain read-only](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/14kb9y7/rhaskell_will_remain_readonly/) by Taylor Fausak
  > Until further notice, r/haskell will be read-only. You can still comment, but you cannot post.

- [Writing prettier Haskell with Unicode Syntax and Vim](https://alt-romes.github.io/posts/2023-06-21-haskell-unicode-syntax-vim.html) by Rodrigo Mesquita
  > A short write-up on combining digraphs, a feature built-in to vim, and Haskell's `UnicodeSyntax` extension, to easily write beautiful Haskell programs with unicode symbols.
