Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Announcing Sydtest's profiling mode](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2023-04-05-sydtest-profiling) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > This post announces the new profiling mode for sydtest with which you can find out why your test suite is slow.

- [Bits in Haskell](https://typeclasses.substack.com/p/bits-in-haskell) by Chris Martin
  > Bitwise arithmetic is not exotic to Haskell; it works just like any other language.

- [Ergonomic newtypes for Haskell strings and numbers](https://www.haskellforall.com/2023/04/ergonomic-newtypes-for-haskell-strings.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This blog post summarizes a very brief trick I commonly recommend whenever I see something where the `newtype`s are not opaque.

- [Haskell in Production: Meta](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production-meta) by Gints Dreimanis
  > This time, we have quite a special guest --- Simon Marlow from Meta. He's one of the co-authors of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and the author of Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell.

- [How to avoid space leaks on lazy setting](https://epicandmonicisnotiso.blogspot.com/2023/04/how-to-avoid-correctness-space-leaks-on.html) by Ruben Astudillo
  > With these patterns in mind, you can avoid most space leaks that are a correctness concern. Sure, it requires care; although I was never of the opinion that lazy evaluation means that you should not care about evaluation.

- [Testing concurrent code using DejaFu](https://nicolast.be/development/testing-concurrent-code-using-dejafu/) by Nicolas Trangez
  > In Haskell, we can use STM to transactionally change state, and DejaFu to test concurrent code. In this post, we look into how this is done, and discuss an approach to simplify the testing effort.
