Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Improving the probabilistic programming language Monad-Bayes](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-10-18-monad-bayes-fellowship/) by Reuben Cohn-Gordon
  > I've spent some time this summer extending Monad-Bayes, a probabilistic programming library in Haskell.

- [Lazily Grouping in Haskell](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2022-10-17-lazy-group-on.html) by Donnacha Oisín Kidney
  > It's not easy to structure programs to have the same property as sort does above: to be maximally lazy, such that unnecessary work is not performed.

- [Testing stateful systems, part two: linear temporal logic](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-10-14-ltl-attacks/) by Carl Hammann
  > On a previous post, we explained how to write tests for stateful systems using traces --- sequences of stateful actions --- that can be combined and modified to write complex test cases easily and transparently.

- [To Lens or not to Lens?](https://tbx.at/posts/lens-impressions/) by Mica
  > For my first steps with Haskell I've evaluated options for handling records, including the optics libraries "lens" and "optics-core".

- [Tree search in Haskell](https://blog.plover.com/prog/haskell/lazy-search.html) by Mark Dominus
  > This is much better because it breaks the generation and filtering into independent components, and also makes clear that searching is nothing more than filtering the list of nodes.

## Show & tell

- [An overengineered Servant REST API for counters](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/an-overengineered-servant-rest-api-for-counters/5186?u=taylorfausak) by Daniel Díaz Carrete
  > I've written a horribly overengineered REST API using Servant. The API lets you create, update and delete counter values.

- [Learn Me a Haskell, Finally](https://github.com/keithfancher/haskell-notes/blob/3d8bd3de99cd5723f7a138e6e861c4ef650284f9/haskell-notes.md) by Keith Fancher
  > Notes about things I keep forgetting, or continue to find confusing, while learning Haskell.
