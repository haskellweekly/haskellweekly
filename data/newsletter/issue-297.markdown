Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

<!-- Runs on 2021-12-09, 2021-12-23, 2022-01-06, and 2022-01-20. -->
- [What skills will give you an edge in 2022?](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell) (ad)
  > Take the Developer Nation survey and share your views about the most important coding skills, tools, and platforms for 2022. You will get a virtual goody bag with free resources, plus a chance to win an iPhone 13, a Nintendo Switch, licenses, Amazon vouchers and more.

- [Databass, Part 2: Inserting into the database](https://blog.josephmorag.com/posts/databass2/) by Joseph Morag
  > Welcome to Databass, Part 2, even more bass. In part 1, we defined a query GADT and runQuery function. Here, we'll figure out how to materialize relations and tuples in memory.

- [A Christmas Story](https://github.com/zw3rk/mobile-core-log/blob/c65940599f2fb480ee8f08ea5a5f812db36a6b15/LOG.md) by Moritz Angermann
  > The following is a story about me, stumbling around ghc, fileformats, libc's, linking and debuggers and overcoming challenges and finding bugs, trying to get the bare minmum of an iOS and Android toolchain to work for compiling Haskell code into libraries to be used on aarch64 mobile devices.

- [Scoped effect resources for Polysemy](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-01-05-polysemy-scoped/) by Torsten Schmits
  > For some kinds of effects, it can be hard to design an expressive interface due to the semantics of their primitive resources. One instance of those are resources whose lifetime is scoped to a small part of a program (called a region in this post), like a database connection.

  > We are making a secure, open-source messenger and video conferencing app. Our backend is one of the oldest commercial Haskell code bases around, but we are constantly modernizing it and have recently adopted libraries like servant and polysemy. Plus we're really nice people! :) If you feel your seniority lies in Software development, but not in Haskell specifically, we'd still like to look at your application. We have an office in Berlin, but also many remote team members.
