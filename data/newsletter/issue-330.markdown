Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 9.4.2 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-4-2-is-now-available/4955) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.4.2. This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few packaging issues found in 9.4.1.

- [Ema 0.8, with composability and generic routes](https://srid.ca/ema-0.8) by Sridhar Ratnakumar
  > Announcing a rewrite of [Ema](https://ema.srid.ca/) (a static site generator library in Haskell with hot-reload, destined to develop an unique kind of apps) with support for generic route encoders and composable sites.

- [Implementing array reverse in PureScript](https://github.com/adrianen-ucm/purescript-array-reverse) by Adrián Enríquez
  > A quick overview of stack safety in PureScript through a simple example.

- [Functional Futures: Across the Kmettverse with Edward Kmett](https://serokell.io/blog/across-the-kmettverse-with-edward-kmett) by Jonn Mostovoy
  > In the episode, we dive into his life story --- how he went from being broke and in debt to learning category theory and authoring numerous Haskell libraries. We also talk about programming languages and projects beyond Haskell that make Edward excited right now.

- [Haskell: How a Lazy Language Was Put to Work](https://obsidian.systems/blog/haskell-lazy-language-put-to-work) by Obsidian Systems
  > This is the first in a series of posts that aims to contextualize Haskell's reputation. As code, Haskell makes it possible to deeply understand what effects a program will and won't have: immutable constants replace variables; functions do nothing but produce their result.

- [How to deal with money in software](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2022-08-22-how-to-deal-with-money-in-software) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > Dealing with money in software is difficult and dangerous. This post contains an overview of the problems you will run into eventually when writing software that deals with money.

- [MuniHac is back in 2022!](https://munihac.de/2022.html)
  > We're glad to announce that MuniHac will be back this year, as an on-site event in Munich.

## In brief

- [Dijkstra's Algorithm in Haskell](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/8/22/dijkstras-algorithm-in-haskell) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today I'll start though with a quick overview of a basic Haskell approach to the problem.

- [pGenie](https://pgenie.io/) by Nikita Volkov
  > SQL transpiler for PostgreSQL. Validates queries, generates multiplatform client code.

## Show & tell

- [bearriver version 0.13.6](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/wu5fi1/ann_dunai090_dunaitest090_bearriver0136/) by X
  > For those unfamiliar, `dunai` is a reactive programming library structured around a notion of Monadic Stream Functions. `bearriver` itself is an API-compatible implementation of Yampa.

- [breakpoint](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/wtrbu8/breakpoint_plugin_released/) by Aaron Allen
  > After attempting to use the built-in breakpoints feature that GHCi provides and running into several critical issues, I decided to write a GHC plugin that implements functionality for debugging Haskell programs using breakpoints.

- [gitlab-haskell version 1.0.0.1](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/wvx3jb/ann_gitlabhaskell_1001_gitlabs_api_in_haskell/) by Rob Stewart
  > This library lifts the GitLab web API into Haskell functions and types. The library also has an event driven API for implementing server-side GitLab file hooks.

- [LeanCheck version 1.0.0](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/wuq3zr/ann_leancheck_v100_enumerative_property_testing/) by Rudy Matela
  > A new version of LeanCheck is out. LeanCheck is a property testing library (like QuickCheck) that tests values enumeratively.

- [unix version 2.8](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/wtjnog/new_release_of_unix28/) by Andrew Lelechenko
  > The changelog is full of improvements, big and small. Among most important ones are support for Abstract FilePath Proposal and compatibility with WebAssembly platform.
