Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [2020 State of Haskell Survey results](https://taylor.fausak.me/2020/11/22/haskell-survey-results/) by Taylor Fausak
  > The fourth annual State of Haskell Survey closed last week. This post will graph the responses, analyze them, and compare them to previous years.

- [2020 State of Haskell survey: an attempt at cluster analysis](https://www.ariis.it/static/articles/2020-haskell-survey-analysis/page.html) by Francesco Ariis
  > This year I decided to attempt cluster analysis on the data.

- [Existential Haskell](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/existential-haskell.html) by Patrick Thomson
  > In this piece, I'll describe a common example of information hiding in ALGOL-style languages like Java, then express that in terms compatible with Haskell.

- [`hs-to-coq` and `Data.Sequence`](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2020-11-23-hs-to-coq-containers-sequence.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > In this post, I will present some of the changes made in `hs-to-coq` to be able to translate `Data.Sequence`.

- [A Queue for Effectful Breadth-First Traversals](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2020-11-23-applicative-queue.html) by Donnacha Oisín Kidney
  > We pick up the story again at the question of a breadth-first (`Applicative`) traversal of a rose tree.

- [Reducing the pain of grouping SQL query results using Haskell](https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/grouping-query-results-haskell/) by Ben Levy & Christian Charukiewicz
  > With a system written in Haskell, we can use the `Semigroup` typeclass and the append operation it exposes (`<>`) to transform the data into the shape we need by defining our desired custom data types and simple transformation functions.

- [A tale of Template Haskell and cross compilation](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-25-asterius-th/) by Cheng Shao & Georgios Karachalias
  > It is less well known that Template Haskell also makes cross compilation with GHC harder.

- [URI Fragment support for Servant](https://an-pro.org/posts/11-servant-fragment.html) by Andrey Prokopenko
  > I would like to have this feature available inside servant core package, since fragment is a part of URI and could be used on both server and client side.

- [Virtual Record Fields Using Lenses](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/virtual-fields) by Chris Penner
  > Lenses are commonly used for getting and setting fields on records, but they're actually much more adaptable than that!

- [Where We Build a Computer](https://www.bulters.dev/posts/where-we-build-a-computer/) by Jeroen Bulters
  > Since I've done some of the challenges last year, I know that there will be a rapid ramp-up in difficulty and that a number of challenges build "on top of each other".

## In brief

- [Haskell in the Real World](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/3d-printing/index.html) by Sandy Maguire
  > It's rare that I actually get to use this stuff I spend so much time thinking about, so thought it would make a nice and quick blog post.

- [Testing the Watcher](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/11/23/testing-the-watcher) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In this video, we'll explore how to simulate file modifications in the middle of a unit test.

- [Trying To Create Syntax Optics](https://yairchu.github.io/posts/attempting-syntax-optics) by Yair Chuchem
  > The journey to create combinators for parsing and pretty-pretting continues!
