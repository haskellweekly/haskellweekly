Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Convenience in Haskell: Ergonomics of Cabal](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/convenience-in-haskell-ergonomics-of-cabal/7897) by Vance Palacio
  > Should we be trying to create some type of wrapper around hpack/cabal that focuses on user experience, avoiding the work of creating a cabal exact-printer, not burdening cabal maintainers with thinking about perfect UX, and leaving cabal alone to be a good packaging tool/power user tool?

- [Episode 35 – Iavor Diatchki](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/35/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Wouter and Niki are joined by Iavor Diatchki to talk about his experience with different Haskell development styles, writing a high assurance wiki in php, and maintaining Haskell code across different GHC releases over multiple decades.

- [GHC activities report: August–September 2023](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/10/ghc-activities-report-august-september-2023/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the twentieth edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. The current edition covers roughly the months of August and September 2023. 

- [`rhine-bayes`: A library for online reactive Bayesian inference](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2023-10-12-rhine-bayes/) by Manuel Bärenz
  > In this blog post, we will learn how to include Bayesian machine learning in a reactive `rhine` application.
  
- [Release: stan, extending support to GHC 9.6](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/release-stan-extending-support-to-ghc-9-6/7888) by Tom Ellis
  > I’m pleased to announce an even newer release of `stan`, a static analysis tool for Haskell. This release extends last week’s release by adding support for 9.6, extending the supported range to 8.8-9.6.
  
- ["Super Haskell": an introduction to Agda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSDgVxdP20g) by André Muricy
  
- [Use traversals for batch operations](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2023-10-12-use-traversals-for-batch-operations.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > Often enough we have an API which may (or need) to provide a batch operation: "give me many inputs, and I'll give you many outputs".

## In brief

- [aeson-unqualified-ast - Aliases to "aeson" AST making it importable unqualified](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-unqualified-ast) by by Nikita Volkov
  > Reasonable type aliases and patterns for the AST definitions of "aeson", which are unlikely to cause any conflicts when imported unqualified.

- [cabal-add: extend build-depends from the command line](https://github.com/Bodigrim/cabal-add/) by Bodigrim

## Show & tell

- [DevOps Weekly Log, 2023-10-18](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/devops-weekly-log-2023-10-18/7896) by Bryan Richter
  > I was able to contribute to the recent Cabal release by repairing some problems with the release pipeline. I’ve also started working on the Stackage migration.

## Call for participation

- [Workshop on the Implementation of Type Systems (WITS) ‘24](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/cfp-workshop-on-the-implementation-of-type-systems-wits-24/7873) by Richard Eisenberg
  > We invite participants to share their experiences, study differences among the implementations, and generalize lessons from those. We also want to promote the creation of a shared vocabulary and set of best practices for implementing type systems.

- [ghcitui: Find broader version ranges for dependencies](https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/ghcitui/issues/9)
- [swarm: Implement more world manipulation functions in world DSL](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/1584)
