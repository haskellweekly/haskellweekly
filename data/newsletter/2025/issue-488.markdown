Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Alpha-beta pruning is just minimax in a lattice of clamping functions](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2025-09-01-alpha-beta.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > A lazy take on a classic game theory algorithm.

- [An Unofficial Guide to What's New in GHC 9.14](https://minoki.github.io/posts/2025-08-31-whats-new-in-ghc-9-14.html) by Arata Mizuki
  > I’ve been writing posts in Japanese over the past few years introducing new features in GHC. I thought such posts might also be useful for readers in the English-speaking community, so with some help from tools like ChatGPT, I’ve translated the latest one into English. I hope this will be helpful when you try out the new GHC.

  > Unifying Parsers, Printers & Grammars.

- [Embedding MicroHs](https://thma.github.io/posts/2025-08-30-Embedding-MicroHs.html) by Thomas Mahler
  > This post shows how to use Lennart Augustsson’s MicroHs as an execution backend for a small combinator compiler and how to embed the MicroHs compiler and runtime into GHC-built programs.
  
- [Baba Yaga is kinda like Toki Pona but for Haskell](https://eli.li/to-the-surprise-of-literally-no-one-im-working-on-implementing-a-programming-language-all-my-own) by Eli Mellen
  > Inspired by conversation at a recent Future of Coding event, I decided I’d write up a little something about the programming language I’ve been working on (for what feels like forever) before I’ve gotten it to a totally shareable state. I have a working interpreter that I’m pretty pleased with, but I don’t yet have an interactive environment for creating, exploring, debugging, and running code — I have this idea for a Smalltalk-flavored infinite canvas dev experience that’ll work in the browser. Hoping that’ll be ready soon(ish)!

## Jobs

- [Hiring a Haskell engineer in NYC!](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1n7c0m3/hiring_a_haskell_engineer_in_nyc/) by Medex Finance
  > I'm using Haskell for my startup, and we're looking for our first engineer outside the founding team.

## In brief

- [Bloodhound 0.24.0.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1n480gj/ann_bloodhound_02400/) by Gautier Di Folco

- [Strict vs Lazy ByteString](https://lehmacdj.github.io/blog/2025/09/01/strict-vs-lazy-bytestrings.html) by Devin Lehmacher
  > However, as a general rule, I recommend sticking to strict ByteStrings as a default.

- [Welcoming a new Haskell Ecosystem Supporter: Standard Chartered](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2025/08/standard-chartered-supports-haskell-ecosystem/) by Adam Gundry
  > Following on from our announcement of Haskell Ecosystem Support Packages, Well-Typed are delighted to introduce Standard Chartered as our first Gold Haskell Ecosystem Supporter.

## Show & tell

- [Diagrams, static map renderer](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/diagrams-static-map-renderer/12855) by Felix Valentini
  > I’ve been on a journey learning Haskell, and what better way to practice than by starting a little project of my own? Since I’m particularly interested in maps, I thought it would be nice to develop a map renderer using Haskell’s wonderful diagrams library.
  
- [Starting out with Graph Algorithms: Basic DFS](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2025/9/1/starting-out-with-graph-algorithms-basic-dfs) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > For a few weeks now, we’ve been tackling problems related to data structures, with a sprinkling of algorithmic ideas in there. Last week, we covered sets and heaps. Prior to that, we considered Matrices and the binary search algorithm. This week, we’ll cover our first graph problem! Graph problems often build on a lot of fundamental layers. You need to understand the algorithm itself. Then you need to use the right data structures to apply it. And you’ll also still need the core problem solving patterns at your disposal.

## Call for participation

- [Topic for Haskell Symposium keynote – any views?](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/topic-for-haskell-symposium-keynote-any-views/12867) by Simon Peyton Jones
  > I am giving a keynote talk at the 2025 Haskell Symposium in October. This message is to ask: what, if anything, would you like me to speak about?

- [haskell-debugger: hdb: Improve printing for some datatypes](https://github.com/well-typed/haskell-debugger/issues/47)
