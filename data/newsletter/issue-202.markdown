Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Monadic Party Speakers and Workshops released!](https://monadic.party) by Monadic Party
  > We have selected speakers for this year's edition of Monadic Party, a four day, three track summer school of Haskell. Join us this year for workshops at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. See the recordings from our previous two editions on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeiYYR2fCXarkfSqqFBwuA/videos).

- [Bringing your Haskell types to Reason](https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/bring-your-haskell-types-to-reason) by Stack Builders
  > One of the challenges that we face in web development is that we are often writing the backend and the frontend in different languages and type systems. To build reliable applications, we need a way to connect both. We can build a bridge that helps us to traverse safely between the backend and the frontend with a code generation tool that allows us to use the same types on both sides of the application. This article is based on the talk presented in [Compose Conference NYC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxUElNb-0Q0)

- [Effectful Property Testing](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2020/03/11/effectful_property_testing.html) by Matt Parsons
  > At work, we have a lot of complex SQL queries written both in `esqueleto` and in raw SQL. We've decided we want to increase our software quality by writing tests against our database code.

- [Get base onto stackage.org](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/base-on-stackage) by Alexey Kuleshevich
  > If you carefully inspect the table of core packages and try to match to available versions on Hackage for those libraries, you will quickly notice that a few of them are missing.

- [Ghc Tags Plugin](https://coot.me/posts/ghc-tags-plugin.html) by Marcin Szamotulski
  > Existing solutions like hasktags do not cover all the new language features, so at times one is left is searching the tree by hand.

- [Haskell with UTF-8](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-with-utf8) by Kirill Elagin
  > This is to announce that we have published a new Haskell library called with-utf8 and we hope that it will help solve this kind of problems once and for all.

- [Tracking Changes to Base](https://www.fosskers.ca/en/blog/base) by Colin Woodbury
  > This post is a reference for library authors to easily track how `base` evolves, and how to deal with its changes.

- [Whole STG program compiler (status report)](https://www.patreon.com/posts/34711849) by Csaba Hruska
  > In the previous months I worked on the whole STG program compilation pipeline implementation.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## In brief

- [Announce: latex-svg packages](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2020-03-06-latex-svg.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > This week Andres Löh asked whether LaTeX can be rendered as SVGs. The answer is yes.

- [Lesson 6: Applicatives compose](https://typeclasses.com/functortown/applicatives-compose) by Type Classes
  > We will be using Reader again in this lesson, but here we will want to see that it can compose with other applicative functors.

- [Making the Jump to Real World Haskell](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/3/9/making-the-jump-to-real-world-haskell) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > So in this article, I wanted to share some of the mistakes I made when I was trying to make that jump. These are what motivated me to make this course, so I hope you can learn from them.

- [Stackage Nightly 2020-03-10 (ghc-8.8.3)](https://www.stackage.org/nightly-2020-03-10)

## Show & tell

- [holmes](https://github.com/i-am-tom/holmes/tree/482e37fac3e51eac088309ffc3789ae00a08a557) by Tom Harding
  > A library for computing constraint-solving problems.

- [mallRL](https://nmaehlmann.itch.io/mallrl) by Nikolas Mählmann
  > A grocery shopping roguelike developed for the 7drl game jam.

- [ooh](https://github.com/complyue/ooh/tree/13ab5e580961198b33327a5f0e00a1ee91ddc668) by Compl Yue
  > I never imagined object oriented stylish program can be written in Haskell in such a way so straight forward!

- [org-mode, org-mode-lucid, and skylighting-lucid](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ffyfkh/ann_orgmode_orgmodelucid_and_skylightinglucid/) by Colin Woodbury
  > Together these can be used to write articles in Emacs' Org Mode, inject that content into a Lucid Html () structure, and get nice syntax highlighting for your code samples.
