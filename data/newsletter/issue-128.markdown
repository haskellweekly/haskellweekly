Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [An introduction to linear regression using Haskell](https://samcgardner.github.io/2018/10/06/linear-regression-in-haskell.html)

    > I decided to stray a little off the beaten track and implement the programming exercises from Andrew's course in Haskell instead. Haskell feels well-suited for this problem.

-   [`elm-beam`](https://kofi.sexy/blog/elm-beam)

    > I've been exploring the idea of an Elm compiler that produces assembly for the Erlang Virtual Machine. This essay documents some interesting parts of the project.

-   [Fullstack Haskell: Reflex and Servant](https://jappieklooster.nl/fullstack-haskell-reflex-and-servant.html)

    > If it were 2005 you may have been able to get away with just blaze. But we are in 2018+, and JavaScript is a problem. In this blog post we will explore how to deal with JavaScript trough reflex and GHCJS.

-   [RAII is better than the bracket pattern](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/10/raii-better-than-bracket-pattern)

    > The RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) approach in both C++ and Rust leads to a nicer solution than even our bracket pattern in Haskell, by (mostly) avoiding the possibility of a premature close.

-   [Announce: Haskell code explorer: Tool that helps understand Haskell codebases](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/9layin/ann_haskell_code_explorer_tool_that_helps/)

    > Haskell code explorer is a web application for exploring and understanding Haskell codebases. It provides the following features: Types and documentation on hover, go to definition, find references, type of each expression & semantic highlighting.

-   [Comprehending monoids with class](https://lptk.github.io/programming/2018/10/04/comprehending-monoids-with-class.html)

    > For expressing queries over collections of data, monoid comprehension can be more flexible, simpler, more efficient, and safer than its monadic counterpart.

-   [Counting inversions with monoidal sparks](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2018/10/06/counting-inversions-with-monoidal-sparks/)

    > Time for me to reveal the example I had in mind that led to the generalization in my previous post. Thanks for all the interesting comments: it seems like there are some interesting connections to be explored.

-   [Detailed walkthrough for a beginner Haskell program](http://www.haskellforall.com/2018/10/detailed-walkthrough-for-beginner.html)

    > This post walks through the development of a small Haskell program for aligning equals symbols in a block of text. This walkthrough targets a beginning programmer by describing several steps and concepts in extra detail.

-   [Making a Haskell interface for the Rosie pattern language](https://whatthefunctional.wordpress.com/2018/10/10/making-a-haskell-interface-for-the-rosie-pattern-language/)

    > The Rosie Pattern Language (RPL) is a DSL for parsing strings which is more convenient and easier to work with than regular expressions. RPL is a Lua library with a C Foreign Function Interface (FFI). I noticed that there wasn't a way to call it from Haskell.

-   [Writing a simple web application](https://qnikst.github.io/posts/2018-10-09-starting-webapp.html)

    > I've talked about adding metrics to the Haskell application. I decided to prepare a full example that can be looked at and reused in later posts and projects.
