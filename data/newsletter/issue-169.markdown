Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [A weekend replication of STOKE, a stochastic superoptimiser](https://github.com/bollu/blaze/blob/75c4ab5c17bda3b751f0d328b19064a2ce1eccfe/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) by Siddharth Bhat

    > STOKE is a superoptimizer that finds optimal instruction sequences to perform a particular task by using numerical techniques which rely on randomness (markov-chain-monte-carlo/MCMC) to explore the space of "all possible programs".

-   [Analyzing Our Parameters](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2019/7/22/analyzing-our-parameters) by Monday Morning Haskell

    > Our goal for this week will be to write some simple analysis functions. These will play through the game without needing to display anything on the screen. Then we'll be able to play different versions in quick succession and compare results.

-   [Dimensions and Haskell: Singletons in Action](https://serokell.io/blog/dimensions-haskell-singletons) by Rinat Stryungis and Danya Rogozin

    > In our previous blogpost, we introduced a reader to our subject matter and briefly observed several numeric libraries in Haskell. In this part, we describe our approach to the matrix data type that is parameterised via its numbers of columns and rows.

-   [GHC 8.8.1-rc1 released](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20190722-ghc-8.8.1-rc1-released.html) by Ben Gamari

    > The GHC team is pleased to announce the second and likely last alpha release of GHC 8.8.1. This release is the culmination of over 3000 commits by over one hundred contributors and has several new features and numerous bug fixes relative to GHC 8.6.

-   [Guide to Implementing Custom Monadic Effects in Issue-Wanted](https://rashadg1030.github.io/rashad-blog/7.html) by Rashad Gover

    > Over the past few weeks I’ve been making steady progress on the issue-wanted project I’m working on for Google Summer of Code 2019. Today I would like to present my work on adding a custom monad/effect to issue-wanted and what I learned during the process.

-   [Insane in the Membrain](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/membrain) by Veronika Romashkina

    > Membrain is not about creating memes, it’s about a type-safe memory data type with units being on the type level, so all the computations are guaranteed to be trustworthy and some of them even performed during compile time.

-   [Lambda the Ultimate Pattern Factory](https://github.com/thma/LtuPatternFactory/tree/85656b63d1d2cf0a0694b45458b56dec37bd76ca) by Thomas Mahler

    > Recently, while re-reading through the Typeclassopedia I thought it would be a good exercise to map the structure of software design-patterns to the concepts found in the Haskell type class library and in functional programming in general.

-   [Parsing With Haskell Parser Combinators](https://github.com/lettier/parsing-with-haskell-parser-combinators/tree/bf97f8b41568e4a72b659f2af79d4dedd397e32d) by David Lettier

    > Need to parse to something? Never heard of a "parser combinator"? Looking to learn some Haskell? Awesome! Below is everything you'll need to get up and parsing with Haskell parser combinators.
