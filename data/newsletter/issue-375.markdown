- [Another weekend side project: Spatial voter modeling in Haskell](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/another-weekend-side-project-spatial-voter-modeling-in-haskell/6842?u=taylorfausak) by Chris Smith
  > I now have a reasonably realistic statistical model of voting behavior, as well as analysis tools for visualizing and analyzing election systems and methodologies and their practical effects.

- [Fearless Tinkering is Functional](https://www.heneli.dev/blog/fearless-tinkering-is-functional) by Heneli Kailahi
  > Is functional programming worth learning? This series is the sales pitch I wish I had received when first being introduced to the world of functions.

- [From Fibonacci to Haskell with some spicy mathematics](https://timothysamson.github.io/posts/fibonacci-haskell/) by Timothy Samson
  > Here's a story about math and programming, with the Fibonacci sequence as it's protagonist.

- [MySQL Persistent Support for Haskell on Windows](https://jappie.me/mysql-persistent-support-for-haskell-on-windows.html) by Jappie Klooster
  > This is a small instructional blog post, primarily for my own reference, on how to get MySQL support for programs on Windows. These steps are for native Windows support. There's no WSL involvement.

- [Using Haskell with devenv.sh](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/using-haskell-with-devenv-sh/6831?u=taylorfausak) by Domen Kožar
  > Most of our code is written in Haskell, so I'd love to support it as a first-class citizen.

- [Why I use the Twain web framework](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2023/07/01/why-i-use-twain) by Gil Mizrahi
  > Recently I've been using Twain for all of my newer web apps instead of Scotty and previously Spock, and I wanted to share why.
