Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GSoC 2019 for mentors: Summertime Codeness](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/gsoc2019) by Kowainik
  > This blog post is our experience summary of mentoring for the first time in Google Summer of Code. Here we want not only to share how it feels to be a mentor but also to try motivating you to become a part of this global community event in the future.

- [Inspecting Haskell Instance Resolution](https://mgsloan.com/posts/inspecting-haskell-instance-resolution/) by Michael Sloan
  > To understand this error, you need to be able to run typeclass machinery in your head and have familiarity with the libraries involved. I think it would be great to add this contextual information to GHC, such that this variety of errors becomes more comprehensible.

- [Unifying Servant server error responses](https://lukwagoallan.com/posts/unifying-servant-server-error-responses) by Lukwago Allan
  > The blog post is a discussion about exceptions in Servant and the `servant-errors` WAI middleware Haskell library, its purpose and implementation details.

- [Announcing termonad-2.0.0.0](https://functor.tokyo/blog/2019-09-13-termonad-2.0.0.0) by Dennis Gosnell
  > Termonad is a terminal emulator written in Haskell. It aims to be the XMonad of terminal emulators.

- [What does a humped critter have to teach us?](https://markkarpov.com/post/what-does-a-humped-critter-have-to-teach-us.html) by Mark Karpov
  > In my opinion, the module system is the most remarkable feature of OCaml. This is why I'm going to talk only about it in this post. It's also a good opportunity to see how it relates to Haskell's type classes.

- [Implementing graceful-close in Haskell network library](https://kazu-yamamoto.hatenablog.jp/entry/2019/09/20/165939) by Kazu Yamamoto
  > Unfortunately, most HTTP/2 server implementations do not close connections gracefully, hence browsers cannot display pages correctly in some situations.

- [What is Good About Haskell?](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2019-10-02-what-is-good-about-haskell.html) by Donnacha Oisín Kidney
  > This post aims to demonstrate some of these features in a simple (but hopefully not too simple) example. I'm going to write and package up a simple sorting algorithm in both Haskell and Python, and compare the code in each.

- [Learn Functional Programming by writing a Scheme in Haskell](https://0x0f0f0f.github.io/posts/2019/09/learn-functional-programming-by-writing-a-scheme-in-haskell/) by Alessandro
  > How to make your first functional programming language. A book review.

- [Autocompletion with deep learning](https://tabnine.com/blog/deep/) by Jacob Jackson
  > TabNine is an autocompleter that helps you write code faster. We're adding a deep learning model which significantly improves suggestion quality.

- [Figuring out how to use Beam for DB migrations](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-09-27-figuring-out-beam-migrations.html) by William Yao
  > This post collects everything I learned while trying to get up and running with Beam's migrations, and should help you get started as well.
