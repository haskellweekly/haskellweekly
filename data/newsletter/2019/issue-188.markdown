Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Advent of Optics: Day 4](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/advent-of-optics-04) by Chris Penner
  > Since I'm releasing a book on practical lenses and optics later this month I thought it would be fun to do a few of this year's Advent of Code puzzles using as many obscure optics features as possible!

- [Four ways to partially apply constraint tuples](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2019/11/30/four-ways-to-partially-apply-constraint-tuples/) by Ryan Scott
