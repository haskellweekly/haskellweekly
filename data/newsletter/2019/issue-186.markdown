Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [2019 State of Haskell Survey results](https://taylor.fausak.me/2019/11/16/haskell-survey-results/) by Taylor Fausak
  > The third annual State of Haskell Survey closed a couple days ago. This post will analyze the results, graph them, and compare them to previous years.

- [Boring Haskell Manifesto](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2019/11/boring-haskell-manifesto) by Michael Snoyman
  > Goal: how to get Haskell into your organization, and how to make your organization more productive and profitable with better engineering.

- [A dead-simple web stack in Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-16-a-dead-simple-web-stack.html) by William Yao
  > Haskell has a proliferation of libraries to choose from for all of your basic backend needs, from logging to database access to routing and web server definition.

- [Multiple public libraries in a single Cabal package](https://fgaz.me/posts/2019-11-14-cabal-multiple-libraries/) by Francesco Gazzetta
  > In summer 2018, during my last GSoC, I developed the "multiple public libraries in a single package" Cabal feature. In this long overdue post I explain why and how to use the feature.

- [Setting up a Haskell environment](https://www.47deg.com/blog/setting-up-haskell/) by Alejandro Serrano
  > This blog post is yet another attempt to provide a simple, step-by-step tutorial to get Haskell running on your machine.

- [Sum algebraic data types in C](https://nullbuffer.com/2019/11/15/algebraic_c.html) by Alessio Chiapperini
  > One can say that sum types feel a lot like a combination of unions and enumerations, and that's true, in fact we'll see how to implement various (sum) algebraic data types in C.

- [Sum types for relational databases](https://blog.typeable.io/posts/2019-11-21-sql-sum-types.html) by Dmitry Olshansky
  > Matt Parsons talks about a few ways to encode sum types in relational databases in his blog. Not so long ago I was thinking about the same problem and came up with slightly different solutions.

- [Time Travelling and Fixing Bugs with Property-Based Testing](https://wickstrom.tech/programming/2019/11/17/time-travelling-and-fixing-bugs-with-property-based-testing.html) by Oskar Wickström
  > This tutorial is based on a simple but realistic system under test (SUT), aiming to show some ways you can test and find bugs in such logic using PBT.

- [Variational Autoencoders in Haskell, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Turn My Friends Into Dogs](https://www.declanoller.com/2019/11/15/variational-autoencoders-in-haskell-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-turn-my-friends-into-dogs/) by Declan Oller
  > If you frequently wander down the dark alleys of the computer science neighborhood of the internet, it won't be too long before you bump into a strange man in a trench coat who says, "Hey, kid ... you ever try Functional Programming?"

- [Winter is coming even more quickly](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/758-Winter_is_coming_even_more_quickly) by Joachim Breitner
  > I explain how I improved the performance of an interpreter for WebAssembly written in Haskell by plucking some low-hanging fruit.

## Jobs
