Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Benchmarks of various trie implementations](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/benchmarks-of-various-trie-implementations/651?u=taylorfausak) by Marco Zocca

    > While studying various approaches to prefix trees ("tries"), I wrote a small memory and time benchmark of four implementations.

-   [Build a HTTP Proxy in Haskell on AWS Lambda](https://medium.com/@chris__bacon/build-a-http-proxy-in-haskell-on-aws-lambda-5cd8ab8cdde4) by Chris Bacon

    > This is just a quick one to put some Haskell code on AWS Lambda, and what's better than a good-old HTTP Proxy?

-   [co-log logging library with polysemy for extensible effects and chronos for fast time](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/blr8op/colog_logging_library_with_polysemy_for/) by Kowainik

    > We are thrilled to share the new release of our multipackage logging library co-log!

-   [Discovering DataKinds at Runtime](https://programmable.computer/posts/datakinds_runtime.html) by Travis Whitaker

    > Something almost universal to introductions to "type-level programming" in Haskell is an example involving sized vectors.

-   [Drawing foldl and foldr](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/753-Drawing_foldl_and_foldr) by Joachim Breitner

    > Often, someone wants to exhaling the difference between a left-fold and a right-fold, i.e. foldl and foldr in Haskell, you see a picture.

-   [Haskell monads and the nest of lies](https://blog.johncs.com/posts/monads-and-how-we-lie.htm) by John Sullivan

    > The IO monad in Haskell works by assuming our universe is in a simulation and that your tiny computer can capture the entire state of the universe and play it forwards in real time.

-   [Higher Kinded Option Parsing](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/hkd-options) by Chris Penner

    > Higher Kinded Data Types (HKDTs) have piqued my interest lately. They seem to have a lot of potential applications, however the ergonomics still aren't so great in most of these cases.

-   [Purity in Haskell](https://alpacaaa.net/haskell-purity/) by Marco Sampellegrini

    > Purity is not about preventing side effects, it's about having a clear boundary between code with side effects and pure code.

-   [Some Tricks for List Manipulation](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2019-05-08-list-manipulation-tricks.html) by Donnacha OisÃ­n Kidney

    > This post is a collection of some of the tricks I've learned for manipulating lists in Haskell. Each one starts with a puzzle: you should try the puzzle yourself before seeing the solution!

## Jobs

-   [Galois is hiring for a variety of roles](https://galois.com/careers/) (ad)

    > Including but not limited to: Software Engineers/Researchers, Project Managers, Hardware Engineers, Red Team Lead, Software Integration Engineer.
    >
    > We collaborate with organizations like NASA, DARPA, and AWS to explore blue sky ideas and turn them into usable technology. Some of the things we've worked on in the past: Formal methods, static analysis, cryptographic algorithms, abstract interpretation, type theory, formal verification, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems assurance, communication security, cyber-deception for network defense, DDoS defense, provable hardware security, and statistical anomaly detection for detecting advanced persistent threats. We think working here is awesome; see [lifeatgalois.com](https://lifeatgalois.com).
