Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Property-Based Testing in a Screencast Editor](https://leanpub.com/property-based-testing-in-a-screencast-editor) by Oskar WickstrÃ¶m
    > Read the case studies and learn how property-based testing uncovered subtle bugs in a complex GUI application.

-   [A reckless introduction to Hindley-Milner type inference](http://reasonableapproximation.net/2019/05/05/hindley-milner.html) by Phil Hazelden
    > I'm writing about it, based on the contents of my talk but more fleshed out and hopefully better explained.

-   [How to write a game in Haskell from scratch](https://morgenthum.tech/articles/write-haskell-game) by Mario Morgenthum
    > I wrote a 2D arcade game called Lambda-Heights in Haskell and want to share my experiences with you.

-   [HSoC --- Hadrian Optimisation: Elusive Unused Imports (Update 6)](https://medium.com/@ratherforky/hsoc-hadrian-optimisation-elusive-unused-imports-update-6-adaa1a7c16e2) by James Foster
    > Since the last update I wrote an absurdly slow unused import tester, did a load of data entry for said tester, and left said tester running over the weekend (when I said slow, I meant slow).

-   [Singleton](https://typeclasses.com/featured/singleton) by Type Classes
    > Whether computing's menagerie of lists is a source of fascination or of annoyance depends on your interests, but regardless the varieties of lists are there and we must choose among them whenever we desire to line things up in a row.

-   [Typed Lisp, A Primer](https://alhassy.github.io/TypedLisp/) by Musa Al-hassy
    > We begin with a shallow comparison to Haskell, a rapid tour of type theory, try in vain to defend dynamic approaches, give a somewhat humorous account of history.

-   [Scarf: Distribute your system packages, understand how they are used, and make money from them](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ctiopc/scarf_distribute_your_system_packages_understand/) by Avi Press
    > It's a way to distribute CLI tools, system packages, etc so that you can automatically capture usage statistics and easily collect payments from users.

-   [Express: Manipulate dynamically typed Haskell expressions involving applications and variables](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/crp5y5/ann_expressv012_manipulate_dynamically_typed/) by Rudy Matela
    > Express allows manipulation of dynamically typed Haskell expressions. It is similar to Data.Dynamic but with support for encoding applications and variables.

## In brief

-   [Releasing two Haskell libraries in one day: libmodbus and git-lfs](https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/releasing_two_haskell_libraries_in_one_day/) by Joey Hess
    > The first library is a libmodbus binding in Haskell. The second library is a git-lfs implementation in pure Haskell.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [unipatterns](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unipatterns-0.0.0.0). Have you ever wanted to match on a really large expression in-line but don't want to bother pulling out a whole case-statement? Scrap your case statements with unipattern matches!
