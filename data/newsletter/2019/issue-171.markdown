Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Dead-simple TCP/IP services using servant](https://blog.jle.im/entry/simple-tcpip-services-servant.html) by Justin Le

    > Servant is usually advertised as a tool for writing web servers, web applications, and REST APIs, but it's easily adapted to write non-web things as well. Let's dive in and write a simple TCP/IP service (a todo list manager) to see how straightforward the process is!

    > A library for building functional reactive terminal applications.

-   [Polysemy is fun! - Part 2](https://haskell-explained.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2019/07/31/polysemy-is-cool-part-2/index.html) by Raghu Kaippully

    > So far we have seen how to define an effect as a data type and how to embed such effect values in the `Sem` monad. But those effects were not "doing" anything. It's all nice to have a good looking program, but what is the point if it does not do something?

-   [type-sets](https://github.com/isovector/type-sets/tree/ae1eaab52f7297fc2ede82b69eb1393d98e95a42) by Sandy Maguire

    > How much do you hate programming at the type level, but only being able to use lists? A million? *Two* million? Some mathematicians suspect that there may be even larger degrees of hate.

-   [Exploring Cloud Builds in Hadrian](https://well-typed.com/blog/2019/08/exploring-cloud-builds-in-hadrian/) by David Eichmann

    > GHC's new build system, Hadrian, now supports a cloud build option: `--share`. With that enabled, build artifacts will be cached and shared between builds.

-   [HSoC --- Hadrian Optimisation: Profiling and getting ahead of Shake changes (Update 5)](https://medium.com/@ratherforky/hsoc-hadrian-optimisation-profiling-and-getting-ahead-of-shake-changes-update-5-6b4038ed18aa) by James Foster

    > This past couple weeks I've fixed some documentation, submitted a bug report for --rebuild and -B doing seemingly wrong but useful things, profiled Hadrian, and opened an MR to get ahead of some Shake changes.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [monad-validate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monad-validate-1.1.0.0), a monad transformer for data validation. It provides the `ValidateT` monad transformer, which is designed for writing data validations that provide high-quality error reporting without much effort.

## Call for participation

-   [pretty-simple: change doctests to use `cabal-doctest`](https://github.com/cdepillabout/pretty-simple/issues/49)
-   [servant: Verb with headers checks content type differently than Verb without headers in servant-client-core](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant/issues/1200)

## Events

Meetup will change their API soon.
As a result we decided to stop maintaining this section.
