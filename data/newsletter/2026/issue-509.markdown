Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Episode 76 – Jeffrey Young](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/76/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Today, Matti and Mike talk to Jeffrey Young. Jeff has had a long history of working with Haskell and on ghc itself. We talk about what makes Haskell so compelling, the good and bad of highly optimized code and the beauty of well-modularized code, how to get into compiler development, and how to benefit from Domain-Driven Design.

- [Haskell Language Server 2.13.0.0 release](https://blog.haskell.org/hls-2-13-0-0/) by VeryMilkyJoe
  > The HLS team is happy to announce the 2.13.0.0 Haskell Language Server release which introduces two new exciting features!
  
- [Hello, Haskell: Getting Started in 2026](https://lukastymo.com/posts/025-hello-haskell-a-hands-on-lab-for-2026/) by Lukasz Tymoszczuk
  > A common observation is that a language may appear strange at first; once learned, other languages can begin to look unfamiliar. The same pattern appears when learning ideas such as type classes and tagless final in Scala: explanations often fail to “click” when the original context has been stripped away. Much of this material was imported from Haskell, adapted with trade-offs and additions, and then presented in isolation; returning to the source often clarifies what the abstraction is doing.

## Jobs

- [Converge is hiring!](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/converge-is-hiring/13593) by Gideon Farrell
  > Converge is hiring for a senior software engineer to join the team. We’ve been slowly building up our pool of Haskellers from just me to four of us (out of ten SWEs).

## In brief

- [Announcing Aztecs v0.17: OpenGL rendering and more engine features](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/announcing-aztecs-v0-17-opengl-rendering-and-more-engine-features/13608) by Matt Hunzinger
  > Rev up your Haskell game engines with the latest Aztecs, an ECS and modular game-engine. The latest `v0.17` adds new packages for working with `OpenGL` using a high-level, ECS-driven API.
  
- [HaskellSpace - A Haskell workspace in your browser (GHC + Stack + HLS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1qlqec6/ann_haskellspace_a_haskell_workspace_in_your/) by LCamel
  > I created a ready-to-use Haskell environment on GitHub Codespaces.
  
- [postgresql-types](https://github.com/nikita-volkov/postgresql-types) by Nikita Volkov
  > Precise Haskell representations of PostgreSQL data types with mappings to and from both binary and textual formats.
  
- [Yank](https://github.com/HosseinAbedi/Yank) by Hossein Abedi
  > A simple, fast downloader with resume and progress. Use the standalone binary or Docker - no Haskell setup required.
  
## Show & tell

- [Dynamic GHC matrix in GitHub CI](https://hasufell.github.io/posts/2026-01-22-dynamic-ghcup-action.html) by Julian Ospald
  > When new GHC versions are released, I often have to go through all my library CI systems and update the ghc version matrix in my github action. You could argue a CI generation system like haskell-CI makes this somewhat simpler, but I’m a strong opponent of generating CI configurations.

## Call for participation

- [GSoC 2026: Final call for ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1qq0eqv/gsoc_2026_final_call_for_ideas/) by Aaron Allen
  > In case you missed it, Haskell will be applying for Google Summer of Code 2026. In order to have a good chance of being accepted, we need a healthy list of projects that prospective contributors can choose from. We’re hoping to have more ideas submitted before the application deadline of Feb 3rd.

- [Improving Machine Arithmetic](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/improving-machine-arithmetic/13602) by mniip
  > I would like to invite some discussion about this topic, what such a package could look like, what changes `base` could look like, etc.

- [RFC: New major version of `yesod-core`](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-new-major-version-of-yesod-core/13592) by Matt Parsons
  > I would greatly appreciate any commentary on this. If you use yesod, try compiling this on your project - if there are any breaking changes or problems, please let me know so I can try to accommodate you. If this really ruins your codebase, or it causes serious problems, let me know so we can figure out a path forward that spares you.

- [swarm: Move `Swarm.Language.*` modules out of `swarm-util`](https://github.com/swarm-game/swarm/issues/2677)
