Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [AmeriHac 2026 retrospective](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/amerihac-2026-retrospective/13682) by José Manuel Calderón Trilla
  > This past weekend we held the first ever AmeriHac, a ZuriHac-style hackathon for the North American Haskell community. When I first proposed the idea of a North American event to the HF board, my criterion for success was simple: 100 attendees. We had 110, so by that measure we succeeded. But numbers are only part of the story, of course.
  
- [hs-bindgen 0.1-alpha release](https://well-typed.com/blog/2026/02/hs-bindgen-alpha/) by Edsko de Vries
  > Well-Typed are delighted to announce a release preview of `hs-bindgen`, a tool for automatic Haskell binding generation from C header files.
  
- [My experience at AmeriHac](https://thedeveloper101.github.io/posts/2026/02/amerihac-experience/) by Sai Divvela
  > This past weekend, I participated in the inagural North American Haskell Hackathon - AmeriHac! It was so much fun, despite not even knowing a single bit of Haskell going into it. I wanna write up a bit about my experience, some lessons I learned and things I hope to do in the future.

- [pandoc 3.9 (+ wasm!)](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-pandoc-3-9-wasm/13659) by Albert
  > Pandoc 3.9 was released yesterday. This is the first release with an official wasm version.
  
## In brief

- [30% faster compile times with GHC for parallel builds #15378](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1qwk8f4/30_faster_compile_times_with_ghc_for_parallel/) by _query
  > This patch is looking for some more reviewers. Also for devs with a big haskell project that have the necessary infrastructure in place: It would be nice if you could test out the patch and report back what impact you are seeing.

- [CPL 0.2.0: a categorical programming language (implemented in Haskell) now runs in your browser via WebAssembly](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1qzy0jv/ann_cpl_020_a_categorical_programming_language/) by msakai
  > In this release, CPL now runs in your browser via WebAssembly with no installation required.
  
- [I made my first compiler! BechML - A friendly higher-kinded, functional scripting language](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/i-made-my-first-compiler-bechml-a-friendly-higher-kinded-functional-scripting-language-wip/13683) by Matt Hunzinger
  > BechML is a pure, higher-kinded, functional programming language that compiles to JS for scripting.
  
- [Preview: Build Mac apps with Haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/1r1viml/preview_build_mac_apps_with_haskell/) by semigroup
  > I’ve wanted to do GUI things on the Mac using Haskell for ages, but never quite managed to crack the problem.

- [Distributors - Unifying Parsers, Printers & Grammars](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/distributors-unifying-parsers-printers-grammars/13673) by Eitan Chatav
  > Distributors provides mathematically inspired abstractions for coders to write parsers that can also be inverted to printers.
  
## Call for participation

- [ZuriHac 2026 Registration Open](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/zurihac-2026-takes-place-6-8-june-registration-open/13675?u=farhad_mehta)
