Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [7 things I learned from Haskell](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2022/12/13/learned-from-haskell) by Gil Mizrahi
  > Sometimes people say that learning Haskell changes the way you think, but they don't always say how or why. So here are 7 concrete things I learned from Haskell.

- [At Least Assert Your Serialisation Roundtrips](https://jezenthomas.com/at-least-roundtrip-serialisation/) by Jezen Thomas
  > When you're writing a web application, the values that flow through your system need to be serialised and deserialised.

- [Building a Haskell CRUD stack with Obelisk for PowerZonePack](https://blog.obsidian.systems/shaping-a-crud-app-in-haskell-for-powerzonepack/) by Obsidian Systems
  > There isn't an abundance online of writing about successful, reliable, and reproducible CRUD stacks for Haskell developers.

- [GHCup state report and 2023 resolutions](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghcup-state-report-and-2023-resolutions/5432?u=taylorfausak) by Julian Ospald
  > Since GHCup is becoming a central tool of development, I want to share some thoughts about the current state, recent work, certain problems and upcoming ideas.

- [GHC activities report: October--November 2022](https://well-typed.com/blog/2022/12/ghc-2022-10-2022-11/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the fifteenth edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. The current edition covers roughly the months of October and November 2022.

- [Haskell in Production: e-bot7](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production-e-bot7) by Gints Dreimanis
  > In this edition of our Haskell in Production series, we feature e-bot7 --- a low-code conversational AI platform designed for customer service and support.

- [JavaScript backend merged into GHC](https://engineering.iog.io/2022-12-13-ghc-js-backend-merged/) by IOG
  > A new JavaScript backend was merged into GHC on November 30th, 2022! This means that the next release of GHC will be able to emit code that runs in web browsers without requiring any extra tools, enabling Haskell for both front-end and back-end web applications.

- [Overloading the lambda abstraction in Haskell](https://acatalepsie.fr/posts/overloading-lambda) by Lucas Escot
  > As recently as 5 days ago, I was still convinced that there was no way to do such a thing without requiring a lot of engineering effort, either through GHC compiler plugins or with Template Haskell --- two things I'd rather stay far away from.

- [Solving Advent Of Code Day 7 With Parsers, Zippers And Interpreters](https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2022/aoc-7) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > In this post, we solve the Advent of Code 2022, Day 7 challenge in Haskell using parsers, zippers and interpreters.
