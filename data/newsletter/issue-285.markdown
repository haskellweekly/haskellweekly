Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC activities report: August -- September 2021](https://well-typed.com/blog/2021/10/ghc-2021-08-2021-09/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the eighth edition of our GHC activities report where we describe the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. The current edition covers roughly the months of August and September 2021.

- [How to protect aeson code from hash flooding](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-10-12-aeson-hash-flooding-protection.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > A new `aeson` release addresses the hash flooding issue, but you need more than a version bump to ensure your programs are protected. This post outlines how `aeson` addressed the vulnerability and what action you need to take.

- [Pattern-matching-based AST Evaluation as Prisms](https://ubikium.gitlab.io/portfolio/2021-10-10-pattern-matching-as-prisms.html) by ubikium
  > This blog post will introduce a way to use prism-like functions to express such complex pattern-matching-based evaluation rules.

- [Testing Polysemy With polysemy-check](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/polysemy-check/) by Sandy Maguire
  > By forcing yourself to think about effects, you are forced to pull concerns apart, and use the type-system to document what's going on. But more importantly for today, it gives us a layer of indirection inside of which we can insert testing machinery.

## Jobs

## In brief

- [Book of Monads](https://leanpub.com/book-of-monads/) by Alejandro Serrano Mena
  > This book provides a journey from the very first concepts, to the myriad of monads available to programmers, down to the categorical foundations.

- [How and why Haskell is better (than your favorite $LANGUAGE)](https://vadosware.io/post/how-and-why-haskell-is-better/) by vados
  > Rah-Rah Haskell posts in 2021? You betcha.

- [Why Haskell?](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2021/10/11/why-haskell) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > When I tell other programmers I do a lot of programming in Haskell, a common question is "Why"?

## Show & tell

- [aeson version 2.0.1.0](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-2.0.1.0/changelog) by Oleg Grenrus
  > Make map type used by Object abstract so the underlying implementation can be modified, thanks to Callan McGill.

- [Cabal version 3.6.2.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-cabal-3-4-1-0-cabal-install-3-4-1-0-cabal-3-6-2-0-cabal-install-3-6-2-0/3412?u=taylorfausak) by Emily Pillmore
  > The Cabal team is excited to announce the release of `Cabal-3.6.2.0`, and `cabal-install-3.6.2.0`.

- [linear-generics](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear-generics-0.1.0.1) by David Feuer
  > This package offers a version of GHC.Generics with two important improvements: The `to`, `from`, `to1`, and `from1` methods have multiplicity-polymorphic types, allowing them to be used with either traditional Haskell code or linearly typed code; and the representations used for `Generic1` are modified slightly.
