Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [How and why I got started with Haskell](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/08/26/how-and-why-i-got-started-with-haskell) by Shayne Czyzewski
  > I decided I'd start learning it on the side and also look for a company that uses it as my next gig. That's how my Haskell journey started, and how I got into Wasp a few months later.

- [Memoization via Representables](https://iagoleal.com/posts/representable-memoize/) by Iago Leal de Freitas
  > What is the most basic container type a language can have? Some people may answer vectors, others would go with hash tables, but in this post I am arguing in favor of functions.

- [Named Routes in Okapi: Part III](https://monadic.systems/post4) by Rashad Gover
  > In the final post of this series, we'll look at how to handle more complicated cases where we need to dispatch on other request information besides the path.

- [The quantified constraint trick](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2022-09-21-quantified-constraint-trick.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > My favorite Haskell trick is how to use quantified constraints with type families.

## In brief

- [Everyday Applicatives!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/9/15/everyday-applicatives) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > I recently revised the Applicatives page on this site, and it got me wondering...when do I use applicatives in my code?

- [Functional Futures: Dependent Types with David Christiansen](https://serokell.io/blog/dependent-types-with-david-christiansen) by Jonn Mostovoy
  > In this month's episode of Functional Futures, our guest is David Christiansen, the Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation, a contributor to a number of dependently typed languages, and a dependent type advocate that has managed to introduce many people to the topic today through his work, talks, and texts.

- [Hello World Haskell](https://blog.drewolson.org/hello-world-haskell) by Drew Olson
  > No, there's no need to worry about IO. In Haskell, when we want to perform an effect, we simply define a GADT to represent the capabilities of the effect.

- [Leet Haskell-Style Lazy Evaluation In Python](https://yairchu.github.io/posts/leet-haskell-in-python) by X
  > While lazy evaluation is very useful, the pervasive lazy evaluation in Haskell (rather than explicit lazy evaluation in other languages) probably causes more trouble than it's worth.

## Show & tell

- [Automatic Differentiation in 38 lines of Haskell](https://gist.github.com/ttesmer/948df432cf46ec6db8c1e83ab59b1b21/0e788a3c895f0f970c03f75130d0d7f27e48ad7f) by Tammo Tesmer
  > You can now differentiate (almost) any differentiable hyperbolic, polynomial, exponential, and/or trigonometric function.

- [Stack version 2.9.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.9.1) by Mike Pilgrem
