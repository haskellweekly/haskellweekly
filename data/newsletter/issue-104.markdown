## Featured

-   [GHC 8.4.2 released](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/blog/ghc-8.4.2-released)

    > The GHC team is pleased to announce the availability of GHC 8.4.2. This release is a bug-fix release, fixing numerous regressions and bugs present in GHC 8.4.1.

-   [Summer of Haskell: Accepted projects for 2018](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2018-04-23-accepted-projects.html)

    > We are happy to announce the 17 projects that have been accepted to participate in Google Summer of Code 2018 for the Haskell.org project. We would like to thank Google for organizing the program, all students who applied for the quality proposals of course the mentors for volunteering to guide the projects!

-   [Funflow: Typed resumable workflows](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2018-04-25-funflow.html)

    > Funflow is a system for building and running workflows. It's a system we've been working on for the last few months with a small number of clients. In this blog post we'll talk about what workflows are, why we built Funflow, and what we'd like to do with it in the future.

-   [Program reduction: A win for recursion schemes](http://newartisans.com/2018/04/win-for-recursion-schemes/)

    > However, despite my enchantment with the beautiful theory --- and especially it's connections with category theory --- it took a while before the promise of these abstraction really paid off. And pay off it did.

-   [Uncanny Haskell](http://blog.vmchale.com/article/uncanny-haskell)

    > Below, I have collected several examples of "uncanny" Haskell. These are things that may be surprising to those who have learned the language merely by doing.

-   [Making a text adventure in Haskell: Part 4](https://whatthefunctional.wordpress.com/2018/04/22/making-a-text-adventure-in-haskell-part-4/)

    > In this final post about my text adventure engine, I'll describe how I updated the state of the game world and how to use the HaskellAdventure game engine to create a full text adventure game.

-   [Deploying confidently: Haskell and Circle CI](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2018/4/23/deploying-confidently-haskell-and-circle-ci)

    > Wherever there are manual steps in our development process, we're likely to forget something. This will almost always come around to bite us at some point. In this article, we'll see how we can automate our development workflow using Circle CI.

-   [Path count](http://www.adomokos.com/2018/04/path-count.html)

    > Given two integer numbers describing an *n* by *m* graph, where *n* represents the height and *m* represents the width, calculate the number of ways you can get from the top left to the bottom right if you can only go right and down.


-   [Null object as identity](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/04/23/null-object-as-identity/)

    > In a previous article you learned how there's a strong relationship between the Composite design pattern and monoids. In this article you'll see that the Null Object pattern is essentially a special case of the Composite pattern.

-   [The HolidayCheck apprenticeship](https://techblog.holidaycheck.com/post/2018/04/20/holidaycheck-apprenticeship)

    > At HolidayCheck we want to consciously and explicitly invest in people. We believe that one of the best possible outputs to be generated by Senior Engineers are more Senior Engineers.

## Jobs

-   [Software engineer at ITProTV in Gainesville, Florida](https://functionaljobs.com/jobs/9080-software-engineer-developer-at-itprotv)

    > ITPro.TV is a fast-growing digital media business that focuses on continuing education in technical domains. We are currently accepting applications for full-stack software professionals to join our small but talented multidisciplinary team.
