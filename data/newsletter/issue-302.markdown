Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Evaluating SKI combinators as native Haskell functions](https://thma.github.io/posts/2022-02-05-Evaluating-SKI-combinators-as-native-Haskell-functions.html) by Thomas Mahler
  > In this post I present an alternative approach to combinator-based implementation of functional languages that is significantly faster than classical graph-reduction based solutions.

- [Every Distributive is Representable](https://duplode.github.io/posts/every-distributive-is-representable.html) by Daniel Mlot
  > At first glance, `Distributive`, the dual to `Traversable`, appears to have little if anything to do with `Representable`, the class for functors isomorphic to functions.

- [Haskell Foundation Executive Director Change](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-executive-director-change/4047?u=taylorfausak) by Andrew Boardman
  > After considering the progress that we have made, the state of the Foundation, and the future we are looking forward to with Haskell as a mainstream industrial language, I have decided to step down as Executive Director.

- [IHP: A Haskell Framework for Type-Safe Web Applications](https://serokell.io/blog/ihp-interview) by Gints Dreimanis
  > Recently, I got the chance to interview Marc Scholten, the CEO of digitally induced. We talked about the framework, their choice of Haskell and Nix as technologies, and how IHP can be an accessible choice for Haskell beginners.

- [Learn You a Haskell](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io)
  > Hey yo! This is an open-source fork of the original Learn You a Haskell (LYAH for short) by Miran Lipovača, "the funkiest way to learn Haskell, the best functional programming language around".

- [ReaderT pattern is just extensible effects](https://喵.世界/2022/02/03/readert-is-extensible-effects/) by Xy Ren
  > In this blog post I'll show how `ReaderT` pattern can be simply transformed into extensible effects.
