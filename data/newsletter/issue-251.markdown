Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Writing AWS Lambdas in Haskell](https://notquiteamonad.com/blog/2021-02-15-writing-aws-lambdas-in-haskell)
  > I wrote a script which allows a collection of Haskell lambdas using the hal runtime to be deployed by CDK.

- [Production Webservers and Concurrent Requests](https://jkeuhlen.com/2021/02/13/Production-Webservers-and-Concurrent-Requests.html) by Jake Keuhlen
  > In this case, it's important to realize that, more often than not, we run our code on linux systems that have their own resource constraints and default limits.

- [Functorio](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2021/02/16/functorio/) by Bartosz Milewski
  > I'm going to show you that real engineering is functional, and I'm going to illustrate it using a computer game that is designed by engineers for engineers.

- [Haskell Database Implementation - Part 1, Growing a Tree](https://dfithian.github.io/2021/02/15/database-implementation-part-1.html) by Dan Fithian
  > In 2020 I set out to correct some of the gaps in my knowledge, and one of the ways I did so was by writing my own database, in Haskell, from scratch.

- [Haskell is vulnerable to dependency confusion](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-02-12-haskell-dependency-confusion.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > In this post, I demonstrate that critical parts of the Haskell package management system are vulnerable to the dependency confusion supply chain attack.

- [Is Alternative a Wrong Abstraction for Handling Failures?](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2021-02-13-alternative.html) by Robert Peszek
  > `Alternative` instances are also known for producing confusing errors. In this post, we do a deep dive into the alternative thinking only about the errors.

- [Masking Asynchronous Exceptions](https://coot.me/posts/mask.html) by Marcin Szamotulski
  > The base library explains asynchronous exceptions and masking quite well, but still this is one of the topics that is often misunderstood.

- [Reanimate 02 - Coordinate systems and Scene](https://mkdoku.github.io/posts/2021-01-31-reanimate-02.html) by Sascha Bubeck
  > In this part of the `reanimate` blog post series we will improve the shape of the star using coordinate transformations and learn to move the star using `Scene` and `Var`.

- [Reflections On Using Haskell For My Startup](https://alistairb.dev/reflections-on-haskell-for-startup/) by Alistair Burrowes
  > Almost exactly one year ago I quit my job to create a Haskell startup as a solo developer.

- [We Made ChatWisely With Haskell](https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2021/02/chatwisely-intro) by Michael Litchard
  > We thought other Haskellers might like to hear about what we're doing and how we use Haskell to do it.
