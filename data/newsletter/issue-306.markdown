  > If you want to learn Haskell and finally understand what people mean by monads in all those Hacker News comments, it's possible.

- [Applicatives should usually implement Semigroup and Monoid](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/03/applicatives-should-usually-implement.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > The above instances come in handy in conjunction with utilities from Haskell’s standard library that work with `Monoid`s.

- [Beginning Haskell Type System, part 1](https://towardsdev.com/beginning-haskell-type-system-part-1-198b2bb42d9e) by C. L. Beard
