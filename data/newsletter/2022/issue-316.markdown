Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [How to lower an IR](https://luctielen.com/posts/how-to-lower-an-ir/) by Luc Tielen
  > In today's article, I show the approach I use when writing a compiler to lower one intermediary representation into another.

- [Announcing monad-logger-aeson: Structured logging in Haskell for cheap](https://jship.github.io/posts/2022-05-17-announcing-monad-logger-aeson/) by Jason Shipman
  > Structured logging is one of those things where once we have it, it's hard to imagine going back to not having it.

- [Comparing strict and lazy](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-05-12-strict-vs-lazy/) by Arnaud Spiwack
  > I first conceived of writing (well, talking, initially) on this subject after one too many person told me "lazy is better than strict because it composes". You see, this is a sentence that simply doesn't make much sense to me, but it is oft repeated.

- [Haskell in Production: SimpleX](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production-simplex) by Gints Dreimanis
  > In this edition of our Haskell in Production series, I interview Evgeny Poberezkin. Evgeny is the creator of SimpleX --- a decentralized messaging and application platform --- and the founder of SimpleX Chat, a company that is one of the operators on the SimpleX network.

- [Model Checking in Haskell, Part 1: Transition Systems and Invariants](https://benjaminselfridge.github.io/posts/2022-05-10-model-checking-1.html) by Ben Selfridge
  > This series of blog posts constitutes a straightforward introduction to model checking, using Haskell code to express the ideas and implement the algorithms.

## In brief

- [Buffering...Please Wait...](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/5/16/bufferingplease-wait) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today we continue our exploration of more obscure IO concepts with the idea of buffering. Buffering determines the more precise mechanics of how our program reads and writes with files.

- [Deprecation of GHCi's tags generation feature](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/deprecation-of-ghcis-tags-generation-feature-starting-with-ghc-9-4/4535?u=taylorfausak) by Théophile Choutri
  > The deprecation process starts with GHC 9.4, which adds warning messages in the console, and follows a three-releases cycle.

- [Episode 12: Gergő Érdi](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/12/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Gergő Érdi is interviewed by Wouter Swierstra and Andres Löh. Gergő has an interesting path into Haskell taking many twists and turns. This episode discusses about these twists and Gergő's recent book on implementing retro computers using Haskell.
