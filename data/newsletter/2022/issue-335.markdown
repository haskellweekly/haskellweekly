Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [3 Ways To Reduce Sharing In Haskell](https://yairchu.github.io/posts/reduce-sharing-in-haskell) by Yair Chuchem
  > Haskell is prone to space leaks, but luckily there are several ways to work around them.

- [Easy incremental Haskell CI builds with GHC 9.4](https://harry.garrood.me/blog/easy-incremental-haskell-ci-builds-with-ghc-9.4/) by Harry Garrood
  > I'm thrilled that the functionality finally made it into GHC 9.4, which means that getting incremental Haskell builds working in CI is easier than ever!
