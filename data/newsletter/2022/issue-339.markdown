Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Template metaprogramming in LLVM with Haskell](https://luctielen.com/posts/template_metaprogramming_in_llvm_with_haskell/) by Luc Tielen
  > In today's article, I show how a single monad transformer can be used to gain template metaprogramming capabilities à la C++ when generating LLVM code in Haskell.

- [Help test XDG support in cabal-install](https://sigkill.dk/blog/2022-10-02-cabal-xdg.html) by Troels Henriksen
  > Cabal, or more precisely cabal-install which is mostly known to Haskellers as the cabal command line program, recently merged a pull request that makes cabal support the XDG Basedir Specification.

- [Internalized Guarded Recursion for Equational Reasoning](http://comonad.com/reader/2022/internalized-guarded-recursion-for-equational-reasoning/) by Gershom Bazerman
  > I recently presented a paper on infinite traversals at the Haskell Symposium: A totally predictable outcome: an investigation of traversals of infinite structures.

- [Learn Monads by Refactor. A Challenge for Beginners](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/learn-monads-by-refactor-a-challenge-for-beginners/5216?u=taylorfausak) by Luis Morillo Najarro
  > I'd like to share a little repo/exercise I build to help new commers. It consists of building the snake game in Haskell. Nothing fancy: no ncurses or frontend, just spit out a bytestring to the console in the shape of a snake board.

- [Looking for a Needle that Might Not Be in an Infinite Haystack](https://www.danielbrice.net/blog/looking-for-a-needle-that-might-not-be-in-an-infinite-haystack/) by Daniel Brice
  > Hand-wavy explanations of my lightning talk of the same title at Mercury's October 2022 PDX Haskell meetup. Based on "Infinite sets that admit fast exhaustive search" by Martín Escardó.

- [A nub in the haystack](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-10-27-bytecode-performance-regression/) by Torsten Schmits
  > This article is an account of my journey into the unknown, describing my approach at setting up the development environment for GHC, and following the obscure clues to identify and eliminate the root cause of this issue.

- [What does "isomorphic" mean (in Haskell)?](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/10/what-does-isomorphic-mean-in-haskell.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > Sometimes you'll hear someone describe two things as being "isomorphic" to one another and I wanted to explain what that means.

## In brief

- [Episode 17: Ningning Xie](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/17/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Ningning Xie is interviewed by Niki Vazou and Andres Loh. Ningning first contributed to GHC at her Google summer of code project with a very ambitious goal of implementing the whole dependent Haskell.

- [Haskell Foundation DevOps Weekly Update, 2022-10-26](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-devops-weekly-update-2022-10-26/5225?u=taylorfausak) by Brian Richter
  > In the last week, I have seen positive results of my CI improvements and made progress on some GitLab service migrations.

  > I'm offering paid consultancy services for improving the maintainability, sustainability and code quality of your Haskell packages.

- [Polymer Expansion](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/10/24/polymer-expansion) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today we're back with another Advent of Code walkthrough. We're doing the problem from Day 14 of last year.
