Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Episode 11: Simon Peyton Jones](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/11/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Simon is the creator of Haskell and in this episode he talks about his new position at Epic, the origins of Haskell and why "it feels right", and the (extra)ordinary Haskell programmers.

- [Modeling PlusCal in Haskell using Cartesian products of NFAs](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/03/modeling-pluscal-in-haskell-using.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > PlusCal is a formal specification language created to model concurrent systems, and recently I became obsessed with implementing PlusCal as an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) in Haskell.

- [New Executive Director for the Haskell Foundation](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/new-executive-director-for-the-haskell-foundation/4290?u=taylorfausak) by Richard Eisenberg
  > It is my great pleasure to announce the next Executive Director of the Haskell Foundation: David Thrane Christiansen. David is a long-time Haskeller who comes with a demonstrated passion for functional programming, having done intensive work with Idris, Racket, and Haskell, among other formative experiences.

- [Pure Print-Style Debugging in Haskell](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/pure-print-style-debugging-in-haskell-c4c5d4f39afa) by Rebecca Skinner
  > In Haskell, where printing something to the screen is a side effect to avoid, it might seem like you need to give up print debugging for the sake of purity.

## In brief

- [RFC: Haskell-in-Production Experience Reports](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/rfc-haskell-in-production-experience-reports/4285?u=taylorfausak) by Santiago Weight
  > I want these reports to accumulate into reference points that might help non-visionaries believe in the economic utility of a language like Haskell.

- [Functional Programming for Physics Geeks](https://nostarch.com/functional-programming-physics-geeks) by Scott Walck
  > This book teaches you to solve physics problems using the functional programming paradigm. Ideal for first-time programmers and science aficionados alike, it introduces the Haskell programming language and encourages the writing of beautiful code to match the elegant ideas of theoretical physics.

- [Making your own Monad](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/3/24/making-your-own-monad) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > You can use transformers to combine these into a monad that is uniquely specific to your application. Today, we'll talk about how to make your monad into its own data type.

- [Monads](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/03/28/monads/) by Mark Seemann
  >  A monad is a common abstraction. While typically associated with Haskell, monads also exist in C# and other languages.

- [Names in Haskell Compilers](http://blog.vmchale.com/article/intern-identifiers) by Vanessa McHale
  > One common oversight in Haskell compilers is failing to intern identifiers using `Int`s and failing to prefer `IntMap`s and `IntSet`s.

- [Our first audit of Minswap and the aftermath](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-03-25-minswap-lp-vulnerability/) by Mathieu Boespflug
  > On the morning of the 22nd of March, 2022, we were notified about the existence of an unknown critical vulnerability on one of Minswap's contracts.
