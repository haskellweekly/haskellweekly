Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GSoC 2022 Ideas](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html)
  > This is a list of ideas for contributors who are considering to apply to Google Summer of Code 2022 for Haskell.org.

- [Introduction to Free Monads](https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-free-monads) by Nikolay Yakimov
  > If you've been around Haskell circles for a bit, you've probably seen the term "free monads". This article aims to introduce free monads and explain why they are useful.

- [A plain English description of monads without Haskell code](https://chrisdone.com/posts/monads/) by Chris Done
  > I've been using Haskell for over a decade and have refrained from writing yet another monad tutorial. A friend asked for an easy explanation of them that doesn't involve Haskell code. That's easier.

- [Showcase: deriving-trans](https://felixspringer.xyz/homepage/blog/derivingTrans) by Felix Springer
  > When creating monad transformer stacks, you usually have to implement some instances manually. Here is a way how this can mostly be avoided.

- [Software Development Languages: Haskell](https://www.fosskers.ca/en/blog/haskell-software-dev) by Colin Woodbury
  > Haskell is an active language used all over the world by normal developers. Code is clean and fast, there are libraries for anything you'd want to do, its concurrency idioms are nearly best-in-class, and maintenance/refactors are much cheaper than some other languages.

- [Underlining the Bugs](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/underline-bugs/index.html) by Sandy Maguire
  > I had a magical Haskell experience today, and want to share the story.

- [GHC Steering Committee Call for Nominations](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-steering-committee-call-for-nominations/3992) by Joachim Breitner
  > The GHC Steering committee is seeking nominations for at least two new members.

- [Haskell Beginners 2022: Free online Haskell course](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-beginners-2022-free-online-haskell-course/4013?u=taylorfausak) by Dmitrii Kovanikov
  > In January 2022 I was teaching a free Haskell course for complete beginners. No prior knowledge of Haskell was required.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (February 2022)](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/shmn9z/monthly_hask_anything_february_2022/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

- [Simple property-based tests for Plutus validators](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/27/simple-property-based-tests-for-plutus-validators/) by Victor Cacciari Miraldo
  > How to write off-chain code with the 'cooked-validators' library and get property-based tests for free.

- [Why I am Learning Haskell](https://chester-beard.medium.com/why-i-am-learning-haskell-d95d1e5212f3) by Chester Beard
  > Okay, okay I know that Cardano has for years now been more hype than an actual project. It has just developed smart contract systems development, so it is only recently that you could develop any working programs for the ecosystem.

## Show & tell

- [cleff](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-cleff-fast-and-concise-extensible-effects/4002?u=taylorfausak)
  > I'm pleased to announce cleff, a new extensible effects library for Haskell.

- [Haskell Language Server version 1.6.1.0](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/releases/tag/1.6.1.0)

- [High-order Virtual Machine (HVM)](https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM/tree/1da287553156dae87b23e1170575af7d73c4531c) by Victor Taelin
  > High-order Virtual Machine (HVM) is a pure functional compile target that is lazy, non-garbage-collected and massively parallel. It is also beta-optimal, meaning that, in several cases, it can be exponentially faster than most functional runtimes, including Haskell's GHC.
