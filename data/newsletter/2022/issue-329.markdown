Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Dynamic Exception Reporting in Haskell](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2022/08/16/dynamic_exception_reporting_in_haskell.html) by Matt Parsons
  > Exceptions kind of suck in Haskell. You don't get a stack trace. They don't show up in the types of functions. They incorporate a subtyping mechanism that feels more like Java casting than typical Haskell programming.
