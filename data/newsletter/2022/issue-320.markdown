Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

<!-- 2022-06-09, 2022-06-16, 2022-06-30, 2022-07-07 -->
- [Developer Nation Survey](https://developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell) (ad)
  > Metaverse, self-driving cars, or Blockchain? Which emerging technology is the most engaging for developers?  What tools have you stopped using and what are your pain points? Take part in the most complete survey we have ever created, shape the key trends among developers for 2022, get free resources and win amazing prizes. Start now!

- [Build haddock documentation of a cabal project](https://coot.me/posts/cabal-haddock-project.html) by Marcin Szamotulski
  > I've been working on a new cabal command: haddock-project which allows to build cabal documentation of a cabal project which possibly consists of multiple packages.

- [Lenses for Tree Traversals Redux](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2022/06/12/lenses-for-tree-traversals-redux.html) by Michael Peyton Jones
  > Previously I wrote about how you can use explicit `Traversal`s from `lens` to simplify some aspects of tree manipulation. I recently had another win using this, so here's another case study!

- [Model Checking in Haskell, Part 2: From Programs to Transition Systems](https://benjaminselfridge.github.io/posts/2022-06-15-model-checking-2.html) by Ben Selfridge
  > In this post, we will take a look at how transition systems can be derived from computer programs. We will develop a very simple imperative programming language, and then we will write a function that converts parallel programs written in this language to transition systems.

- [Monadic parser combinators in Haskell](https://deepsource.io/blog/monadic-parser-combinators) by Srijan Paul
  > We're going to start by writing a library that describes several tiny parsers and functions that operate on those parsers. Then, we're going to build some parsers to demonstrate the usefulness of our work.

## In brief

- [Episode 13: David Christiansen](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/13/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > David Christiansen is interviewed by Alejandro Serrano and Wouter Swierstra. They talk about many functional programming things, from Idris to Racket and of course Haskell and David's new role as the executive director of Haskell Foundation.

- [Exception Type Details](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/6/13/exception-type-details) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today, we'll go over some more details behind the way these exception types work. We'll consider how one might catch all exceptions, but also why this might not be a good idea.

- [Seeking Volunteers: Haskell Experience Reports](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/seeking-volunteers-haskell-experience-reports/4586?u=taylorfausak) by Santiago Weight
  > In order to spread the word of Haskell in production, I am setting up Haskell Experience Reports, which will promote the voices of those using Haskell to build client-facing products.

## Show & tell

- [Hatlab: a WIP-library inspired by Matlab and NumPy](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/hatlab-a-wip-library-inspired-by-matlab-and-numpy/4673?u=taylorfausak) by Humr DruhÃ½
  > Hatlab is supposed to be a library which works with multi-dimensional arrays in the similar fashion as Matlab or NumPy.
