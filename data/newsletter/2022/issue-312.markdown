Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Create recursion schemes using comonads](https://luctielen.com/posts/create_recursion_schemes_using_comonads/) by Luc Tielen
  > In today's post, I explain how comonads can be used to create a tailor-made recursion scheme to perform computations based on multiple simultaneous folds over a single recursive datatype.

- [Announcing webauthn](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-04-21-webauthn/) by Erin van der Veen & Silvan Mosberger
  > Tweag and Mercury are happy to announce a server-side library for the the WebAuthn specification (part of the FIDO2 project), available as webauthn on Hackage!

- [Combining Ideas: mapAccum](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/4/18/combining-ideas-mapaccum) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In the last couple weeks, we've learned about folding and scanning, which are valuable tools for replacing conventional for loops in our Haskell code. Today we'll go over a lesser known idea that sort of combines folding and scanning (or just folding and mapping).

- [DevOps engineer for the Haskell Foundation](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/devops-engineer-for-the-haskell-foundation/4404?u=taylorfausak) by Andrew Lelechenko
  > On behalf of the DevOps Hiring Committee I'm thrilled to announce that Bryan Richter will be joining HF as a DevOps engineer from mid May.

- [Introduction to Doctests in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/doctests-in-haskell) by Nurlan Alkuatov
  > Documenting software can be challenging, but it doesn't always need to be so. In this article, we'll introduce doctests: a concept that makes the documentation process pleasant and effective.

- [Let's go find out!](https://blog.plover.com/brain/last-stop.html) by Mark Dominus
  > One question that came up in several interviews was "why do you want to learn Haskell?" I had a lot of trouble with this question, and often rambled about the answer to some other question instead.

- [Prospective Haskell.org applicants for Google Summer of Code](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/u47fyq/prospective_haskellorg_applicants_for_google/)
  > If you're interested working on some exciting Haskell projects over the summer while earning a stipend for your work and being part of a blossoming community then join our community discord to learn more about us and the programme.
