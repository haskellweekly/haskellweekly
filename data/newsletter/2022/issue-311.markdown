Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC activities report: February--March 2022](https://well-typed.com/blog/2022/04/ghc-2022-02-2022-03/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the eleventh edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. The current edition covers roughly the months of February and March 2022.

- [An Interface for accessing Environment Variables](https://felixspringer.xyz/homepage/blog/anInterfaceForAccessingEnvironmentVariables) by Felix Springer
  > For me dependent types are the most natural way to semantically reason about programs. Unfortunately dependently typed languages are not really production-ready yet. Haskell and GHC often come close enough.

- [It Doesn't Have to Be Arbitrary](https://tech.freckle.com/2022/04/07/it-doesnt-have-to-be-arbitrary/) by Michael Gilliland
  > At Freckle, we have a large Haskell codebase that's rigorously tested using randomized data and property-based testing. After years of defining `Arbitrary` instances we've come up with the following guidelines to keep test overhead low and maximize the benefits of property-based tests.

- [Two for One: Using `concatMap`](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/4/11/two-for-one-using-concatmap) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today's for-loop replacement is a simpler one that combines two functions we should already know! We'll see how we can use `concatMap` to cover some of the basic loop cases we might encounter in other languages.

- [What's That Typeclass: Monoid](https://serokell.io/blog/whats-that-typeclass-monoid) by Gints Dreimanis
  > In programming, there's a pattern that occurs very frequently --- putting together two things of the same type to get another thing of that type. Given its frequency, it would be nice to have some useful abstractions for it.

## Show & tell

- [Copilot version 3.8 and Ogma version 1.0.2](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/u2fkkg/ann_copilot_38_ogma_102_new_papers/) by Ivan Perez
  > A few weeks ago we put out Copilot 3.8. Copilot is a Runtime Verification framework that compiles to hard real-time C99. The effort at present is on stability, cleaning, and providing further assurances with the code generated.

- [idiomatic](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/idiomatic-0.1.0.0) by Baldur BlÃ¶ndal
  > `Idiomatically` is used with `DerivingVia` to derive `Applicative` for types with multiple constructors.

- [linear-builder](https://github.com/Bodigrim/linear-builder/tree/2696ae6950a01e60a7841748929e80ae3e827814) by Andrew Lelechenko
  > Linear types for linear times! Builder for strict `Text`, based on linear types.

- [Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/majjoha/simulated-annealing/tree/c9ea52d0de5b186c83c80c38f2011607d4dcb5dc) by Mathias Jean Johansen
  > As the algorithm runs, it stores each step of the optimization process in a tour history, and once the algorithm has finished execution, it will animate these steps using SDL2.
