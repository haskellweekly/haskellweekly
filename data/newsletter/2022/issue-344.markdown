Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

  > Today we're going to look at how to express a complex algorithmic problem using equality constraints, so that GHC can solve it for us. Namely, we'll make GHC solve some subset of the deterministic fragment of the Minesweeper game.

## Jobs

<!-- Runs from 2022-11-17 to 2022-12-08. -->
- [Move Your Career Forward Developing Haskell at an AI Startup (Remote)](https://bit.ly/subtle-haskell) (ad)
  > Subtle Medical has a very successful product offering and contracts in hand, but the company needs additional help delivering on all those contracts. If you might be interested in developing Haskell to provide the tools to accelerate delivery and thereby contribute prominently to the company's success, then we'd love to start a conversation. If you're reading this, then you're already the kind of person that we want to talk to.
