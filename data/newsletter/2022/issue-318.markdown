Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Compiling a Subset of JavaScript to ARM Assembly in Haskell](https://www.micahcantor.com/blog/js-to-asm-in-hs/) by Micah Cantor
  > In this post, I won't cover every detail of the design of the compiler, but I'll try to hit on what I found to be the most important or interesting aspects of the code.

- [Generate web forms from pure functions](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/05/generate-web-forms-from-pure-functions.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This is an announcement post for my "Grace browser" project. This project is a web page which can dynamically convert a wide variety of functional programming expressions to their equivalent HTML.

- [GHC 9.2.3 is now available](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20220527-ghc-9.2.3-released.html) by Zubin Duggal
  > The GHC developers are very happy to at announce the availability of GHC 9.2.3. This release includes many bug-fixes and other improvements to 9.2.2.

- [Haskell Libraries I Love](https://evanrelf.com/haskell-libraries-i-love) by Evan Relf
  > I just wanted to share some of my favorite Haskell libraries, and why I love them. Most of my projects use most of these libraries.

- [Text-Mode Games as First Haskell Projects](http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2022/05/28/text-mode_games_as_first_haskell_projects/) by Jack Kelly
  > I think text-mode games can grow very smoothly alongside a programmer learning a new language, so here's some thoughts on how to get started, how you might extend a game, and some advice for Haskell specifically.

- [Writing tests for GHC](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2022-05-31-ghc-test-suite.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > In this post I explain how to write functional tests for GHC, with examples.

## Jobs

- [NoRedInk is hiring for Full Stack Engineers!](https://www.noredink.com/job_post?gh_jid=3032749) (ad)
  > Teaching kids to think critically and communicate effectively has never been more important, and NoRedInk helps students become better writers in more than 60% of middle and high schools in the U.S. We're looking for a talented Full-Stack Engineer excited to build features as part of a collaborative team of engineers, product managers and designers focused on furthering our quest to help every student harness the power of the written word.
