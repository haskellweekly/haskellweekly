Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Dijkstra Comparison: Looking at the Library Function](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/9/5/dijkstra-comparison-looking-at-the-library-function) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today, we'll look at the API for a library implementation of this algorithm and compare it to the implementations I thought up.

- [Linear Combinations of Applicatives](https://sonatsuer.github.io/linear-combinations-of-applicatives.html) by Sonat SÃ¼er
  > On a given type constructor of the appropriate kind, there is at most one `Functor` instance and it can be derived automatically. There is no analog of this for `Applicative`s.

- [More recursive definitions](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/792-More_recursive_definitions) by Joachim Breitner
  > Haskell is a pure and lazy programming language, and the laziness allows us to write some algorithms very elegantly, by recursively referring to already calculated values.

- [nix-serve-ng: A faster, more reliable, drop-in replacement for nix-serve](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/09/nix-serve-ng-faster-more-reliable-drop.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > Our team at Arista Networks is happy to announce nix-serve-ng, a backwards-compatible Haskell rewrite of nix-serve. It provides better reliability and performance than nix-serve.

  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

## Show & tell

- [Horizon Haskell Platform](https://horizon-haskell.net) by Dan Firth
  > Nix-first build plans for GHC 9.4.2 and beyond.

- [Stack version 2.9.0.1 release candidate](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/rc/v2.9.0.1) by Mike Pilgrem

- [xmonad verison 0.17.1](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-xmonad-and-xmonad-contrib-0-17-1-are-available/5010?u=taylorfausak) by Tony Zorman
  > About 10 months after the big release of 0.17.0, we --- as promised --- picked up the pace a bit and are back with a new minor version.

- [XStatic](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray/haskell-xstatic/tree/060da0fc5c7a526de34616573fd6a9feee560822#readme) by Tristan de Cacqueray
  > The goal of XStatic family of packages is to provide static file as Haskell library to be installed using cabal.
