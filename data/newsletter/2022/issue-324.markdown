Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Functional programming is finally going mainstream](https://github.com/readme/featured/functional-programming) by Klint Finley
    > Object-oriented and imperative programming aren't going away, but functional programming is finding its way into more codebases.

-   [Open-Source Haskell: 21 Awesome Projects, Tools, and Libraries](https://serokell.io/blog/best-haskell-open-source-projects) by Gints Dreimanis
    > In discussions about Haskell, sometimes a question is raised --- what exactly can you build with the language? To answer this question, this article will look at some of the more interesting Haskell open-source projects on GitHub.

-   [Persistent data structures in functional programming](https://blog.softwaremill.com/persistent-data-structures-in-functional-programming-c5e5061bade3) by Krzysztof AtÅ‚asik
    > We will take a brief look at persistent implementations of two well-known data structures: a linked list and a binary search tree.

-   [Writing a GHC Plugin + Preprocessor for the first time](https://brandonchinn178.github.io/blog/2022/07/11/writing-a-ghc-plugin-and-preprocessor-for-the-first-time.html) by Brandon Chinn
    > I won't be going into too much detail about what it does, but I wanted to quickly go over some of the technical hurdles in implementing the library, and what I learned in this process.

## In brief

-   [Data Structures: Maps!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/7/11/data-structures-maps) by Monday Morning Haskell
    > Today, we're debuting the third part of the series, looking at the Map data type. If you missed the last couple parts, you can also head to the Series Page and take a look!

-   [Haskell Foundation DevOps Weekly Log, 2022-07-08](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-devops-weekly-log-2022-07-08/4750?u=taylorfausak) by Bryan Richter
    > The main result of this week was a spurious failure dashboard. It is currently updating in real time for every CI job that runs in the GHC project. I also backfilled some historic data.

-   [The Haskell Foundation Technical Working Group - volunteers wanted!](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/the-haskell-foundation-technical-working-group-volunteers-wanted/4757?u=taylorfausak) by David Christiansen
    > The purpose of this group is to serve as an advisory organization for both the HF management and the Haskell community as a whole, by evaluating specific proposals for projects that can have broad, ecosystem-wide effects.

-   [Singletons in Haskell](https://felixspringer.xyz/homepage/blog/singletonsInHaskell) by Felix Springer
    > If you are deep into Haskell you've probably come across the singletons library. You may have shied away, because it looked scary, but really the main concept is actually quite straight-forward.

## Show & tell

-   [SimpleX Chat: v3.0 of iOS and Android apps is released](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/vwjeww/simplex_chat_the_first_messaging_platform_that/) by Evgeny Poberezkin
    > SimpleX Chat is an open messaging platform that eliminates most meta-data from the communication - it is the only platform we know of that has no user identifiers of any kind.
