Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haskell series part 10](https://blog.kalvad.com/haskell-series-part-10/) by Pierre Guillemot
  > This is the tenth and last article of a series on the functional language Haskell for beginners. In this article we discover data types and Maybe.

- [Automating Wordle](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/wordle/index.html) by Sandy Maguire
  > After two days of doing it by hand, like a damn pleb, I decided it would be more fun to try to automate this game.

- [A case study on correctness and safety testing of stateful systems](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-01-26-property-based-testing-of-monadic-code/) by Victor Miraldo
  > In this post I will present a technique to do testing using traces which can can be used with arbitrary stateful systems.

- [The computation of appending lists at the type and value level](https://bor0.wordpress.com/2022/01/24/the-computation-of-appending-lists-at-the-type-and-value-level/) by Boro Sitnikovski
  > In this post, I will show different implementations of appending two lists together, written both in Haskell and in Idris, as well as some observations around the differences.

- [Databass, Part 3: Using the database](https://blog.josephmorag.com/posts/databass3/) by Joseph Morag
  > We're going to port the professional hitmen example from William Yao's which type-safe database library should you use blog post to Databass and see how it stacks up.

- [Monoids are Composable List Summarizers](https://cdsmithus.medium.com/monoids-are-composable-list-summarizers-77d2baf23ffc) by Chris Smith
  > It goes something like this: a monoid is any way to summarize a list so that you can combine just the summaries of two lists to get a summary of their concatenation.

## In brief

- [Folding the unfoldable](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2022-01-25-folding-unfoldable.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > This (just a little) tongue-in-cheek post is "inspired" by the fact that statistics package wants unboxed vectors everywhere, for "performance" reasons, and that is soooo inconvenient.

- [Math-y List Operations](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/1/24/math-y-list-operations) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Earlier this month we explored some functions related to booleans and lists. Today we'll consider a few simple helpers related to lists of numbers.

- [Nixpkgs overlays are monoids](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/01/nixpkgs-overlays-are-monoids.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > Nixpkgs supports overriding sets of packages using overlays and these overrides bear many similarities to object-oriented inheritance.

- [Review: Clowns to the Left of Me, Jokers to the Right](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/clowns-jokers/index.html) by Sandy Maguire
  > At a high level, CJ generalizes the results from The Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts, wondering about what happens to a zipper when we don't require the elements on either side to have the same type.

- [Type-level DI Container prototype](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2022/01/24/type-level-di-container-prototype/) by Mark Seemann
  > People sometimes ask me how to do Dependency Injection (DI) in Functional Programming, and the short answer is that you don't.

## Show & tell
