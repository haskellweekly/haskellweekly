Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haskell in Production: Caribou](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production-caribou) by Gints Dreimanis
  > Our today's guest is Syed Jafri, a Senior Software Engineer at Caribou --- a company that helps car owners get quotes on refinancing and insurance. He managed to successfully pitch and introduce Haskell at Caribou.

- [Haskell Server Pages With Okapi](https://monadic.systems/post7) by Rashad Gover
  > I wanted to see if Haskell Server Pages (HSPs) could be implemented with Okapi. What would they look like, how would they function, and how would they compare to server pages in other languages?

- [rec-def: Minesweeper case study](https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/796-rec-def__Minesweeper_case_study) by Joachim Breitner
  > He was once implementing the game Minesweeper in Haskell, and in particular the part of the logic where, after the user has uncovered a field, the game would automatically uncover all fields that are next to a "neutral" field.

- [Serious bug in GHC 9.4 on basic math on aarch64](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-devs/2022-October/020969.html) by Ian-Woo Kim
  > We found a reproducible error with a simple math test (div/mod) on aarch64.
