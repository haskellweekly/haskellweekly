Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## In brief

- [Further Filtering](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/6/20/further-filtering) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > There are a lot of different IO errors our program could throw. And sometimes, we only watch to catch a few of them.

- [Fusing Industry and Academia at GitHub (Experience Report)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09206)
  > The development of Semantic has relied extensively on the functional programming literature; this paper describes how connections to academic research inspired and informed the development of an industrial-scale program analysis toolkit.
