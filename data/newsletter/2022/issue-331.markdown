Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Building Haskell for Omni OS](https://www.hobson.space/posts/haskell-omni/) by James Hobson
  > Instead of blowing the dust of a really old solaris build of GHC and building newer and newer versions, the easiest way to bring haskell to a new platform is to cross compile.

- [Cognitive Loads in Programming](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2022-08-30-code-cognitiveload.html) by Robert Peszek
  > This long post presents programming in a different light than what is commonly considered. We will look at cognitive aspects of interacting with code.

- [Dijkstra with Type Families](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/8/29/dijkstra-with-type-families) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > This is a perfectly valid implementation, but I wanted to go one step further and try out a different approach to generalization.

- [Haskell in Production: Mercury](https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-in-production-mercury) by Gints Dreimanis
  > Our today's guest is Max Tagher. He's the co-founder and CTO of Mercury, a company that provides banking products to startups. Read further to learn where Mercury uses Haskell, why they chose it, and what they like about it.

- [How to make a Haskell program 5x faster with 16 lines of code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRVjR9XcuPU) (video) by Alexis King
  > In this video, she presents "one example of optimizing a Haskell program in some particular way that really focuses on a particular approach --- which, in this particular example, is going to involve looking at GHC core."

- [Incrementally package a Haskell program using Nix](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/08/incrementally-package-haskell-program.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This post walks through how to take a standalone Haskell file and progressively package the file using Nix. In other words, we will tour a spectrum of packaging options ranging from simple to fancy.

- [Types for top-level definitions](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2022/08/27/types-for-top-level-definitions/) by Brent Yorgey
  > I've come up with idea for a type system for first-class (global) definitions, which can serve as a very lightweight alternative to a proper module system.

## Show & tell

- [aeson-dependent-sum](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson-dependent-sum-0.1.0.1) by Jack Kelly
  > These wrappers are helpful when parsing JSON objects where certain keys determine the type of the deserialised value.

- [hegg](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-e-graphs-and-equality-saturation-hegg-0-1/4974) by Rodrigo Mesquita
  > hegg stands for haskell e-graphs good, and it's a library featuring e-graphs (a data structure that efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions) and a high level API for equality saturation (an optimization/term-rewriting technique).

- [Hero](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/x1rfwn/hero_a_faster_ecs_library_for_haskell/)
  > I wanted to use an ECS system in Haskell and I have found `apecs` and `ecstasy`. However, both seem to use `IntMap` for storing component data, so I figured that performance could not be all that great.

- [IHP version 0.20](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.20.0) by Marc Scholten
  > A new IHP release, containing bug fixes and productivity improvements to existing features.

- [purescript-backend-optimizer](https://github.com/aristanetworks/purescript-backend-optimizer/tree/44697a9ff5ba805dbc831b9a12ed0f145583d53f) by Arista Networks
  > An optimizing backend toolkit and modern ECMASCript backend for PureScript.
