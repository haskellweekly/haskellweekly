Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Bluefin compared to effectful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MgahTBF5ig) by Tom Ellis
  > Comparison of Bluefin and effectful effect systems for Haskell. A talk given by Tom Ellis (Bluefin developer) to CircuitHub.
  
- [First 6 months with the Haskell Foundation](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/first-6-months-with-the-haskell-foundation/10720) by Mike Pilgrem
  > I joined the Foundation’s board about six months ago, as a hobbyist and Haskell fan. Not coming from industry or academia, there was a lot to learn. I thought I’d take stock of what I’ve discovered.
  
- [Haskell For Dilettantes 16 - More Applicatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7jvmojo78k) by 
Tea Leaves
  > Peter works on trying to use the Applicatives we defined in the previous lesson. He remains very confused by the typeclass.
  
- [Haskell Foundation October 2024 Update](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-october-2024-update/10707) by José Manuel Calderón Trilla

- [Haskell Security Response Team - 2024 July–October report + new members](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-security-response-team-2024-july-october-report-new-members/10730) by Fraser Tweedale
  > The Haskell Security Response Team (SRT) is a volunteer organization within the Haskell Foundation that is building tools and processes to aid the entire Haskell ecosystem in assessing and responding to security risks. In particular, we maintain a database of security advisories that can serve as a data source for security tooling. This report details the SRT activities from July through October 2024. We extended this reporting period by one month to include the results of our recent Call for Volunteers.

## In brief

- [Using Witch to convert between structurally similar types](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/using-witch-to-convert-between-structurally-similar-types/10704) by Taylor Fausak
  > Witch is a library of mine that allows you to confidently convert between values of various types. I’m happy to announce version 1.2.3.1, which adds the ability to define generic conversions between types that are structurally similar.

## Show & tell

- [Polymorphism and Type Classes in Haskell](https://youtu.be/9j7TSeYtHhw) by LigerLearn
  > An exploration into polymorphism and type classes in Haskell for beginners. We begin with understanding simple parametric polymorphism and then go through a tour of what a type class is and how you can define type class instances. We also look at the Haskell Prelude's in-built type class hierarchy. Part of the [Intro to Functional Programming with Haskell Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMWwct3_kb-2xtOziG1gQYMVr691GadR4).

- [Making haskell-language-server loading more reponsive and smooth](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/making-haskell-language-server-loading-more-reponsive-and-smooth/10709) by Patrick Wales
  > In larger projects, HLS often loads slowly. One of the main obstacles is that we are loading GHC options for files in strict sequential order.
