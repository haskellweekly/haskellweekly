Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Episode 60: Haskell: purely functional and statically typed programming language](https://nurkiewicz.com/60) by Tomasz Nurkiewicz
  > Haskell takes these characteristics to the extreme. For example, doing any input/output is considered impure from a functional programming point of view.

- [Game rules with a Free Monad DSL](https://roganmurley.com/2021/12/11/free-monads.html) by Rogan Murley
  > This post is about how and why my multiplayer card game GALGA uses a Free Monad DSL for its game rules. If that's gobbledygook to you, read on and hopefully it'll make at least a little more sense by the end!

- [GHC activities report: October--November 2021](https://well-typed.com/blog/2021/12/ghc-2021-10-2021-11/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the ninth edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. The current edition covers roughly the months of October and November 2021.

- [Understanding Space Leaks From StateT](https://free.cofree.io/2021/12/13/space-leak/) by Ziyang Liu
  > In this blog post I'll explain using a small program how space leaks can still occur when using the strict `StateT` and the strict `modify'`.

## In brief

- [Do You Know Where Haskell Is Used?](https://typeable.io/blog/2021-12-13-haskell-usage) by Catherine Galkina
  > One of our recent posts described useful Haskell-based utilities, but all of them are intended to be used by tech-savvy people. Today we're going to give some examples of practical use in various industries.

## Show & tell
