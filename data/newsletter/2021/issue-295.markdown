Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

<!-- Runs on 2021-12-09, 2021-12-23, 2022-01-06, and 2022-01-20. -->
- [What skills will give you an edge in 2022?](https://www.developereconomics.net/?member_id=haskell) (ad)
  > Take the Developer Nation survey and share your views about the most important coding skills, tools, and platforms for 2022. You will get a virtual goody bag with free resources, plus a chance to win an iPhone 13, a Nintendo Switch, licenses, Amazon vouchers and more.

- [Write your GDB scripts in Haskell](https://luctielen.com/posts/write_your_gdb_scripts_in_haskell/) by Luc Tielen
  > In this post, I will show how you can use the new debugger-hs library in Haskell to generate GDB scripts.

- [Announcing Stack Lint Extra Deps](https://tech.freckle.com/2021/12/17/announcing-stack-lint-extra-deps/) by Patrick Brisbin
  > Freckle is happy to announce a new command-line tool for linting a Stack-based Haskell application. If you make heavy use of `extra-deps`, this tool may be useful to you.

- [Composing Transformers](https://felixspringer.xyz/homepage/blog/composingTransformers) by Felix Springer
  > There exists a certain kind of monad transformers. I'm talking about all transformers that have lawful instances of `MonadTransControl` from the `monad-control` library.

- [Cross-platform Notes](https://incoherentsoftware.com/defect-process/docs/cross-platform-notes.html) by Incoherent Software
  > This page contains notes on the build process for cross-platform distribution, and other platform specific details. The per-platform notes described below are used for the production builds on Steam, the public GitHub repository uses a simpler configuration that works on all platforms but doesn't handle redistribution.

- [Parser Combinators in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/parser-combinators-in-haskell) by Heitor Toledo Lassarote de Paula
  > If you are reading this, you likely have decided to take on the journey of learning parser combinators. We hope this article will make your adventure smoother and hopefully give you a strong foundation for writing your grammars.

- [Type-level sharing in Haskell, now](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2021/12/type-level-sharing-now/) by Well-Typed
  > We recently discovered a way to solve this problem, in ghc as it is today. In this blog post we will describe the approach, as well as introduce a new typechecker plugin which makes the process more convenient.

## In brief

- [Downhill](https://andriusstank.github.io/downhill/) by Andrius Stankevičius
  > Downhill library proposes an approach to automatic differentiation that is both well typed and simple.

- [Episode 7: José Calderón](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/7/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > José Calderón is interviewed by Niki Vazou and Wouter Swierstra . José has been working on functional programming at Galois and University of Maryland. He tells us about his research background in many different continents, his experience with teaching compilers, the relation between music and functional programming and the "Recursive Programming Techniques" book that in the 1970s captured the essence of functional programming.

- [Haskell Training](https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings/tree/214013fc324fd6c8f63b874a58ead0c1d3e6788c) by Google
  > This repository contains the source for the slides and the exercises used in the Haskell trainings at Google. Haskell is not one of the internally "blessed" languages, but a dedicated team of volunteers is making use of 20% time to try to make Haskell at Google possible!

- [TypeVille Conference](https://www.typeville.io)
  > Join the Scalar descendant, a 5-day conference full of programming and fun! We’re opening the event to  type-safe languages: Java, Haskell, Kotlin, Rust and TypeScript, and Scala remains a focal point of the event and our TypeVille community.

## Show & tell

- [hpack-dhall](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hpack-dhall-0.5.4) by Phil de Joux
  > Use hpack phrasing in dhall to write cabal files. There are two main reasons why you'd use hpack-dhall, convenience and safety.
