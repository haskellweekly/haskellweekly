Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Announcing Hasura GraphQL Engine 2.0!](https://hasura.io/blog/announcing-hasura-graphql-engine-2-0/) by Tanmai Gopal
  > On behalf of the entire team at Hasura, I'm delighted to announce the release of Hasura GraphQL Engine 2.0 (also just called Hasura 2.0).

- [Haskell Database Implementation - Part 2, Domain Specific Language and Transactionality](https://dfithian.github.io/2021/02/18/database-implementation-part-2.html) by Dan Fithian
  > In the last post I wrote about creating an underlying tree structure. This post is about creating a DSL and managing transactions.

- [New updates for Sockets and Pipes](https://joyofhaskell.com/posts/2021-02-19-stm-chapter.html) by Chris Martin
  > The fourth draft of Sockets and Pipes is now available on Leanpub! It includes chapter 10, Change, which deals with using STM to add a stateful component to the web server.

- [PureScript and Haskell](https://blog.drewolson.org/purescript-and-haskell) by Drew Olson
  > Once I had learned PureScript and become more comfortable with purely functional idioms, the next logical step seemed to be learning Haskell.

- [Semiring](https://typeclasses.com/semiring) by Type Classes
  > A semiring is like a double monoid. That is, it's a set equipped with _two_ binary associative operations, often written (+) and (â‹…) on analogy with the canonical integer monoids addition and multiplication

- [Totality](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/totality) by Veronika Romashkina & Dmitrii Kovanikov
  > In this blog post, we want to provide a comprehensive guide to the concept of totality in Functional Programming by demystifying its meaning, giving a lot of examples, and recommending how to get tools to help you write maintainable, testable code.

- [haskell-language-server version 1.0.0](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/releases/tag/1.0.0) by Junyoung Clare Jang
  > This is the celebratory release of Haskell Language Server 1.0.0! This release includes a lot of internal changes, bug fixes, leaks plugged, and performance improvements, thanks to all our contributors.

- [record-dot-preprocessor](https://github.com/ndmitchell/record-dot-preprocessor/tree/4ad15f9a6d30056b9916511aa1d1d2236167c95e) by Neil Mitchell
  > This feature has been proposed for Haskell as `RecordDotSyntax`. The `record-dot-preprocessor` brings this feature to Haskell today.
