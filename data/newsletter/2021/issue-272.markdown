Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Cast Haskell values with Witch](https://taylor.fausak.me/2021/07/13/witch/) by Taylor Fausak
  > I'm happy to announce Witch, a library that aims to make those conversions easy and painless. This post will explain my motivation for creating the library and show some examples of how to use it.

- [Cheap interpreter, part 4: stack machines](https://cuddly-octo-palm-tree.com/posts/2021-07-11-cwafi-4/) by Gary Verhaegen
  > In this post, we're going to explore a completely different approach: we're first going to design a stack machine, then write an interpreter for the stack machine language, and finally write a compiler from our toy language parse tree to stack machine instructions.

- [Exploring linear traversable using generics](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-07-08-linear-traversable/) by Sjoerd Visscher
  > The design of a library like `linear-base`, Tweag's standard library for Haskell's linear types, requires many choices. One of these choices for `linear-base` is what a linear `Traversable` type class should look like.

- [Forget about lenses, let's all implement array-backed anonymous records for fun](https://blog.monadfix.com/weekend-records) by Artyom Kazak
  > I propose a new weekend project: array-backed anonymous records. I am not going to walk you through the entire implementation, just enough to get you going.

- [Haskell Books](https://www.extrema.is/articles/haskell-books) by Travis Cardwell
  > This page provides a tagged index of English books related to the Haskell programming language.

- [Haskell series part 1](https://blog.kalvad.com/haskell-series-part-1/) by Pierre Guillemot
  > After some retrospection I wanted to share my own introduction to Haskell based on my python experience. What I wished I had learnt first and what I wished I learnt later down the road.

- [Template Haskell Performance Tips](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2021/07/12/template_haskell_performance_tips.html) by Matt Parsons
  > One of the main downsides to TemplateHaskell is that it can cause compilation times to increase significantly. Let's dig into these slowdowns and talk about how to make them a bit less onerous.

## Jobs

<!-- Runs on 2021-07-08 and 2021-07-15. -->

## In brief

- [A bitter pill for Microsoft Copilot](https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/a_bitter_pill_for_Microsoft_Copilot/) by Joey Hess
  > Perhaps it's time to think about non-copyright mitigations. Here is an easy way, for Haskell developers. Pick an extension and add code that loops when it's not enabled.

- [Classical Logic vs Intuitionistic Logic](https://www.typetheoryforall.com/2021/07/14/10-Classical-Logic-Vs-Intuitionistic-Logic-(Thorsten-Altenkirch-and-Anupam-Das).html#af7de88c) by Type Theory Forall
  > In this episode we host a discussion between Anupam Das and Thorsten Altenkirch on the role of constructivism in mathematics, logic and computer science.

- [Making Sense of Monads!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2021/7/12/making-sense-of-monads) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > This week we'll take another look at a function-related concept, but we'll relate it to our new monads course. We're going to explore the "function monad".
