Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Artyom's Haskell toolbox](https://toolbox.brick.do) by Artyom Kazak
  > I work as a Haskell consultant at Monadfix. I've been using Haskell for 10 years. Here are the libraries/tools I use.

- [Basic Data Scraping in Haskell Part 1: HTTP and JSON](https://zacwood.me/posts/haskell-scraping-1/) by Zac Wood
  > In this short series, I will walk you through scraping JSON data from the web using basic libraries, and eventually bringing it into the IHP web framework to be used in an actual application.

- [Compile-Time Evaluation in Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/compile-time-evaluation-haskell) by Vladislav Zavialov
  > That's why you are about to see not one, not two, but three ways to do compile-time evaluation in Haskell (there may be more, but let's not get too esoteric).

- [Elementary programming](https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2021/01/02/elementary-programming.html) by Michael Peyton Jones
  > So we have a dilemma: abstraction is great for the advanced users, but is inevitably going to make your code hard for less advanced users to understand.

- [A First Look at Info Table Profiling](https://well-typed.com/blog/2021/01/first-look-at-hi-profiling-mode/) by Matthew Pickering & David Eichmann
  > In this post, we are going to use a brand-new (at the time of writing) and still somewhat experimental profiling method in GHC to show how to identify a memory leak and the code causing it.

- [Hacking Haskell in a Scottish castle](https://fpcastle.com) by Satnam Singh
  > At some point I hope to move back to Scotland to start a software company in a castle. We will specialize in using Haskell to write high quality code for discerning customers.

- [Issue #2](https://bindthegap.news/issues/02dec2020.html) by Bind the Gap
  > We are delighted to present our second issue of Bind The Gap (BTG), which also happens to be the special festive winter issue!

- [Lessons Learned From A Year Of Writing Haskell](https://wespiser.com/posts/2021-01-03-Lessons-Learned-From-A-Year-Of-Haskell.html) by Adam Wespiser
  > The majority of my Haskell experience is in the form of writing code for web servers that talk to databases serve up APIs, although I am very interested in compilers and language research!

## In brief

- [Coindexed optics](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2021-01-04-coindexed-optics.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > Recently I run into documentation of `witherable`. There is `Wither`, which is like a lens, but not quite. I think that is closer to what coindexed optics could be.

- [Compiler Performance in Haskell](http://blog.vmchale.com/article/compiler-performance) by Vanessa McHale
  > Here, I'd like to report my experience with my Kempe toy compiler, which is written in Haskell.

- [How exactly ExceptT differs to EarlyDo](https://chrisdone.com/posts/exceptt-vs-early-do/) by Chris Done
  > After reading some sincere responses failing to see why I bothered with this at all, it seems I haven't explained myself well.

- [HTTP share with S3 and Haskell](https://anardil.net/2019/http-share-with-s3-and-haskell.html) by Austin
  > At work, we use Apache HTTP indexing for easy sharing of files internally; sometimes you just want a link rather than full NFS access.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (January 2021)](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/kntpkm/monthly_hask_anything_january_2021/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

- [Solving Advent of Code "Handy Haversacks" in Type-level Haskell](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/type-level-haskell-aoc7/) by Abhinav Sarkar
  > I have been trying to use type-level programming in Haskell to solve interesting problems since I read Thinking with Types by Sandy Maguire.

- [Theory of iteration and recursion](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2021-01-03-iterative-categories.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > So there is a sense in which these are equivalent, but that already presumes that they are not exactly the same.

- [Thoughts on the logging framework](https://qnikst.brick.do/thoughts-on-the-logging-framework) by Alexander Vershilov
  > In this post, I  want to share my view on implementing the logging library, what features should be implemented with care, what should be irrelevant and why.

- [Trying to compose non-composable: monads](https://iokasimov.github.io/posts/2021/01/composable-monad-transformers) by Murat Kasimov
  > How many times have you heard "monads do not compose"? I've spent a lot of time trying to contradict this statement.

- [The visitor pattern is essentially the same thing as Church encoding](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/01/the-visitor-pattern-is-essentially-same.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This post explains how the visitor pattern is essentially the same thing as Church encoding (or BÃ¶hm-Berarducci encoding).
