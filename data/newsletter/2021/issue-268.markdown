Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Haskell by Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyEkIXFmuNQ&list=PLp2qifo30hMuNgmUUhgl82DTK2JTUqK6M) by Michael Oswald
  > This is a ongoing video series for beginners/intermediates about a possible way to develop a Haskell application which processes binary satellite data and displays the results in a graphical user interface.

- [An AsciiDoc processor and Pandoc front-end in Haskell](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-06-15-asciidoc-haskell-pandoc/) by Guillem Marpons
  > This post presents a new AsciiDoc parser and converter in Haskell, called `asciidoc-hs`. It aims to be the first AsciiDoc processor that can be directly used as a Pandoc front-end.

- [The Fixed Point](https://rebeccaskinner.net/posts/2021-06-09-getting-to-the-fixed-point.html) by Rebecca Skinner
  > In this post, you'll work through the fixed point function in haskell, building several examples along the way. At the end of the post you'll come away with a deeper understanding of recursion and how haskell's lazy evaluation changes the way you can think about writing programs.

- [GHC activities report: April--May 2021](https://well-typed.com/blog/2021/06/ghc-2021-04-2021-05/) by Well-Typed
  > This is the sixth edition of our GHC activities report, which is intended to provide regular updates on the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed. This edition covers roughly the months of April and and May 2021.

- [How to move a 400-person hackathon online](https://www.juricho.me/posts/online-hackathon/) by Juri
  > Hackathons are different enough from conferences that we had to come up with our own approach. Here are some notes on what we learned.

- [Median Heaps in Haskell](https://micahcantor.xyz/blog/median-heap-haskell) by Micah Cantor
  > Usually, the highest priority value is defined as either the minimum or maximum value in the data, as implemented in min and max heaps respectively. In this post, however, we will look at a more specialized heap that instead prioritizes the median value.

- [Years later, REST-ish Services in Haskell Part 4](https://vadosware.io/post/rest-ish-services-in-haskell-part-4/) by Victor Adossi
  > In this post I go through a bunch of improvments and extras to the code from part 3, 2 years after this initial series was started.

- [ZuriHac 2021](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/zurihac-2021-is-happening-in-a-week/2645?u=taylorfausak) by Jasper Van der Jeugt
  > This is a final reminder that ZuriHac is taking place next weekend, Friday 18 June - Sunday 20 June 2021.
