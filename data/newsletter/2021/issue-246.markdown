Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Developer Economics Survey](https://www.developereconomics.net/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=haskell&utm_campaign=haskell_newsletter) (ad)
  > New Developer Economics 20th edition survey is live! This is your chance to have a say in the development trends for 2021. To celebrate the 20th survey anniversary, Developer Economics has prepared $17,000+ USD worth of prize draws. The survey is open until February 8th 2021. Don't miss the chance!

- [Calling C++ from Haskell](https://luctielen.com/posts/calling_cpp_from_haskell/) by Luc Tielen
  > In this article, I show some techniques for calling C++ code from Haskell without using TemplateHaskell.

- [Hacking with Haskell](https://0xdab0.medium.com/hacking-with-haskell-28887c1f2d06) by Max Harley
  > There's probably a tool for managing nmap scans already, but with the power of the semigroup, an nmap management tool should be easy to implement.

- [Hakyll how-to: Fancy title formatting](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-01-11-hakyll-title-formatting.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > Sometimes you need special formatting in an article title. The standard Hakyll metadata block doesn't offer a good way of doing this. But Hakyll is very flexible.

- [Haskell dark arts, part I: Importing hidden values](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-01-07-haskell-dark-arts-part-i/) by Cheng Shao & Richard Eisenberg
  > What if we tell you this encapsulation can be broken, and you can import hidden functions with ease? Of course, this comes with some caveats, but no spoilers --- read the rest of the post to find out how (and when).

- [Making an IO](https://cronokirby.com/posts/2021/01/making-an-io/) by Lúcás Meier
  > Now, this is not really an attempt on explaining monads, or IO. This post is just a progression of ideas around implementing something like IO.

- [Permutate parsers, don't validate](https://juliu.is/permutate-parsers/) by Ju Liu
  > In this post, I would like to go through a practical example that shows the power of bringing this concept to its limits.

- [Philosophies of Rust and Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/philosophies-rust-haskell/) by Michael Snoyman
  > In this post, I want to look at some of the philosophical underpinnings that explain some of the similarities and differences in the languages.

- [Trouble in paradise: Fibonacci](https://github.com/effectfully/sketches/tree/212bf24a81011498ea8084590231c0d200ad28e8/trouble-in-paradise-fibonacci)
  > In this post I'll demonstrate just how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot with laziness using the classic example of computing Fibonacci numbers.

- [Why Haskell is our first choice for building production software systems](https://www.foxhound.systems/blog/why-haskell-for-production/) by Christian Charukiewicz
  > In this post I will cover some of the defining features of Haskell that make it an excellent, industrial-strength language that is well-suited for building commercial software, and why it is usually the first tool we consider using for new projects.

## In brief

- [2020 Retrospective](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/33.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Using Adam Wespiser's blog post as a jumping off point, Cameron Gera and Taylor Fausak look back on a year of Haskell.

- [Benchmarks of discrimination package](https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2021-01-07-discrimination-benchmarks.html) by Oleg Grenrus
  > I originally posted these as a Twitter thread. Its point is to illustrate that constant factors matter, not only the whether it is O(n), O(n log n) or O(n^2) (though quadratic is quite bad quite soon).

- [Generate PureScript data types from Haskell data types](https://fpbyintuition.medium.com/generate-purescript-data-types-from-haskell-data-types-a8568254a37c) by Ong Yi Ren
  > This seemes to be an automatable process so I decided to find a way to let the computer do the work for me!

- [The Haskell Language Server with Zubin Duggal](https://www.compositional.fm/haskell-language-server) by Compositional
  > In this episode, Roman Cheplyaka talks to Zubin Duggal who contributed to HLS for years, personally, through various Summer of Code projects and recently as a Tweag Open Source Fellow.

- [An introduction to ghc-debug: precise memory analysis for Haskell programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zuAsGk9xoM)
  > I will be introducing ghc-debug to Zubin Duggal in the context of using it to analyse memory usage of ghcide.

- [Learn how to build Haskell applications](https://alpacaaa.net/simple-haskell-book/) by Marco Sampellegrini
  > In this book we will create a Continuous Integration Server from scratch. We'll start from zero lines of code and will finish with a working CI Server.

- [Overlappable instances](https://lukasz-golebiewski.github.io/haskell/effects/2021/01/06/overlappable-instances.html) by Łukasz Gołębiewski
  > There are many patterns, styles and libraries which can be chosen for dealing with effects in Haskell. Today I'll try to bring closer one of them.

- [Scrive Nix Workshop](https://scrive.github.io/nix-workshop/)
  > This book contains the workshop materials used for training Haskell developers at Scrive.

- [Why exactly I want Boring Haskell to happen](https://tek.brick.do/a6d9388a-208e-4b18-a219-85457faf69aa) by Artyom Kazak
  > My working hypothesis right now is that Haskell should be split into "Haskell" and "Boring Haskell".
