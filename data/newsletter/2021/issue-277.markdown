Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.10.6 is now available](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20210814-ghc-8.10.6-released.html) by Zubin Duggal
    > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the availability of GHC 8.10.6. Source and binary distributions are available at the usual place. This is a bugfix release, fixing many issues present in GHC 8.10.5.

-   [Abstraction in Reflex and CodeWorld](https://itnext.io/abstraction-in-reflex-and-codeworld-a1b42ad36923) by Chris Smith
    > I've put together a neat example lately of using FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) to cleanly separate and model the interactions of the pieces of an interactive application: in this case, an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator.

-   [Announcing Spectacle --- A language for Writing and Checking Formal Specifications in Haskell](https://awakesecurity.com/blog/spectacle-a-language-for-writing-and-checking-formal-specifications-in-haskell/) by Jacob Leach
    > We initially designed Spectacle as a replacement for TLA+ in specifying critical infrastructure at Awake Security, improving areas that we found frustrating while using TLA+.

-   [Core Haskell tools](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2021/08/14/hs-core-tools) by Gil Mizrahi
    > In this guide we'll take a look at a few core tools that are installed with the Haskell toolchain. Specifically, `ghc`, `runghc` and `ghci`.

-   [How Free Monads Yield Extensible Effects](https://blog.cofree.coffee/2021-08-16-how-free-monads-yield-extensible-effects/) by Solomon Bothwell
    > The `Free` monad can also be used to construct extensible effect systems. I never understood why `Free` why this was the case. It turns out it is deeply connected to their ability to yield monads for functors.

-   [Namespaced De Bruijn indices](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/08/namespaced-de-bruijn-indices.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
    > In this post I share a trick I use for dealing with bound variables in Dhall that I thought might be useful for other interpreted programming languages.

-   [Upcoming IHP Developer Subscription](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/community/ShowThread?threadId=fcb678e6-8ccb-426e-963a-6ba60a97731d) by Marc Scholten
    > As the time needed for developing and maintaining IHP is growing I've been looking for solutions to enable digitally induced to focus on IHP in a more sustainable way.

-   [What the Industrial Coder Misses](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/p41yxp/my_book_introduction_to_the_haskell_world/) by Zoltán Tóth
    > I wrote a free book. It is not a Haskell tutorial. Rather introduction to the concepts.

-   [Why is Learning Functional Programming So Damned Hard?](https://cscalfani.medium.com/why-is-learning-functional-programming-so-damned-hard-bfd00202a7d1) by Charles Scalfani
    > My Functional Programming journey was filled with dead ends, false starts, failed attempts and frustration. And I suspect that I'm not alone in this struggle.

-   [Write your AWS DevOps tool in Haskell for Great Good](https://blog.oyanglul.us/devops/write-aws-tool-in-haskell) by Jichao Ouyang
    > Let's just simply compare AWS CLI, Haskell Amazonka, and official Go SDK with the following very simple tasks.

## Show & tell

-   [servant-util: Extending servant with Database Integration](https://serokell.io/blog/introducing-servant-util) by Kostya Ivanov
    > The logic where this boilerplate appears may be not solely about webservers, but also about databases, and so the fact that `servant` does not help us here is justified.
