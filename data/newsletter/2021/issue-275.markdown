Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [What can I refactor for you today?](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/what-can-i-refactor-for-you-today/2820?u=taylorfausak) by Ari Fordsham
    > That's why I'd like to offer my services, as a Haskell consultant, to maintain and refactor existing code, either yours or someone else's.

-   [Best practices for foreign imports](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20210709-capi-usage.html) by Ben Gamari
    > When importing system libraries we strongly recommend that users use GHC's `capi` calling convention.

-   [Cheap interpreter, part 7: register machines](https://cuddly-octo-palm-tree.com/posts/2021-08-01-cwafi-7-register-machine/) by Gary Verhaegen
    > In this post, we move further into the list of techniques presentetd in Neil's talk and take a look at another type of low-level machine called a register machine.

-   [GHC curiosities: Equality constraints in kinds](https://ryanglscott.github.io/2021/08/01/equality-constraints-in-kinds/) by Ryan Scott
    > In this post, we will investigate why this special case exists and explore the things one can do with it.

-   [Haskell for the Elm Enthusiast](https://blog.noredink.com/post/658510851000713216/haskell-for-the-elm-enthusiast) by No Red Ink
    > Over the years we've developed our style of writing Haskell, which can be described as very Elm-like (it's also still changing!).

-   [Haskell series part 2](https://blog.kalvad.com/haskell-series-part-2/) by Pierre Guillemot
    > As promised, what we are going to cover in this article are: lists and function declarations.

-   [How IHP uses Haskell's Type System to enforce good patterns](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ShowPost?postId=58a9eeea-755a-4a90-8b08-c7e90bbda869) by Jannis Jorre
    > After reading this article you'll hopefully understand how IHP is making use of Haskell's strong typesystem to enforce proper use of patterns shared between all IHP applications, which prevents your production webapp from becoming a legacy webapp.

-   [My ideal GraphQL framework for Haskell](https://brandonchinn178.github.io/blog/2021/08/04/graphql-server-haskell.html) by Brandon Chinn
    > Below, I'll first go over what I'd like in a GraphQL server framework, and then what that ideal GraphQL framework might look like.

-   [Stealing Impl from Rust](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2021/07/29/stealing_impl_from_rust.html) by Matt Parsons
    > With the new `OverloadedRecordDot` language extension, we can use the `.` character to access stuff on records.

-   [Tying Shoes with GADTs](https://www.morrowm.com/posts/2021-08-02-shoes.html)
    > Anyone who ties either of their shoes before putting them on is a no-go, though. And since my Haskell file is my world, and GHC is my enforcer, let's make this state of affairs unrepresentable.

## Jobs

## In brief

-   [Alternative](https://typeclasses.com/alternative) by Type Classes
    > The `Alternative` class is all about recovering from failure: try one thing, and if it doesn't work, try another.

-   [fromMaybe is Just a fold](https://danso.ca/blog/frommaybe-is-just-a-fold/) by Dan Soucy
    >  The `Foldable` type-class exists to capture the pattern of types which can be folded in some way using a function.

-   [Haskell Foundation July Update](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-july-update/2812?u=taylorfausak) by Andrew Boardman

-   [When Howard Met Curry](https://antitypical.com/posts/2021-07-28-when-howard-met-curry/) by Rob Rix
    > The Curry-Howard correspondence is a map for moving between logic and type theory, relating propositions with types and proofs with programs.

## Show & tell

-   [haskell-language-server version 1.3](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/releases/tag/1.3.0) by Junyoung Clare Jang
    > 2021 July release of HLS arrives! This release includes binaries for GHC 9.0.1 and some new interesting features.

-   [hs-term-emulator](https://github.com/bitc/hs-term-emulator/tree/8dd067c5c9c66b412b5b483c589bb3dd0b72950a) by Bit Connor
