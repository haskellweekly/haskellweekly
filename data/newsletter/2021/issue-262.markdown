Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Errors are Values Too](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/2021/05/05/errors-are-values-too/) by Marko Dimjašević
  > Errors are values too, just like values we get on a happy path.

- [Building a GraphQL to SQL Compiler on Postgres, MS SQL and MySQL](https://hasura.io/blog/building-a-graphql-to-sql-compiler-on-postgres-ms-sql-and-mysql/) by Phil Freeman
  > The release of Hasura 2.0 included one of the most exciting features to date - multiple database backends, and in particular, support for our first new backend, Microsoft SQL Server.

- [Haskell Foundation with Andrew Boardman](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/44.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Curious about the Haskell Foundation? This week we interview Andrew Boardman, its Executive Director. He explains the Foundation's purpose and how you can help.

- [Haskell: Monoids](https://cstml.github.io/2021/05/03/haskell-monoid.html) by Vlad Posmangiu Luchian
  > Well believe it or not, Haskell defines a Monoid as a Typeclass, that lets you do funky stuff. Great! Let's have a go and demonstrate these funky useful stuff.

- [Quick and dirty backpropagation in Haskell](https://mazzo.li/posts/haskell-backprop-short.html) by Francesco Mazzoli
  > In this post, we will train a simple neural network in Haskell using backpropagation.

- [Sanity check your dependencies with Template Haskell](https://blog.monadfix.com/sanity-th) by Artyom Kazak
  > This post describes a small pattern that lets us avoid bugs in production.

- [Specifying State Machines with Temporal Logic](https://wickstrom.tech/programming/2021/05/03/specifying-state-machines-with-temporal-logic.html) by Oskar Wickström
  > Quickstrom uses linear temporal logic (LTL) for specifying web applications. When explaining how it works, I've found that the basics of LTL are intuitive to newcomers. On the other hand, it's not obvious how to specify real-world systems using LTL.

- [SSA transformation for GHC's native code generator (Part 2)](https://cptwunderlich.github.io/2021/04/30/ssa_for_ncg_part2.html) by Benjamin Maurer
  > In the first part, I explained the motivation to bring SSA-transformation to GHC's NCG. Here, I want to look at the implementation challenges, decisions and results.

- [The trick to avoid deeply-nested error-handling code ](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/05/the-trick-to-avoid-deeply-nested-error.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This post documents a small trick that I use to avoid deeply-nested error-handling code. This trick is a common piece of Haskell folklore that many people either learn from others or figure out on their own.

- [Write your own Discord bot in Haskell with calamity](https://morrowm.github.io/posts/2021-04-29-calamity.html) by MorrowM
  > `calamity` is the most fully-featured library for writing Discord bots on Hackage, rivaling frameworks like `discord.py` and `discord.js` in features, while offering all the benefits of Haskell: a strong type system, pure functions, and risk-free refactoring
