Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [The tale of `keepAlive#`](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20210607-the-keepAlive-story.html) by Ben Gamari
  > This post will give some background on `touch#`, describe the rationale for this change, discuss some of the alternatives that were evaluated on the way to this new design, and provide some guidance on how this change affects users.

- [Why I Support the Haskell Foundation](https://medium.com/geekculture/why-i-support-the-haskell-foundation-1ac3cda1f82f) by Chris Smith
  > I recently decided to become a major contributor to the Haskell Foundation, and I'm writing about the reasons behind my decision. In short, there's a real opportunity here and we're always stronger when we act together.

## In brief

- [Competitive programming in Haskell: folding folds](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2021/06/19/competitive-programming-in-haskell-folding-folds/) by Brent Yorgey
