Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Developer Economics Survey](https://www.developereconomics.net/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=haskell&utm_campaign=haskell_newsletter) (ad)
  > New Developer Economics 20th edition survey is live! This is your chance to have a say in the development trends for 2021. To celebrate the 20th survey anniversary, Developer Economics has prepared $17,000+ USD worth of prize draws. The survey is open until February 8th 2021. Don't miss the chance!

- [A bulletin board website using Haskell, scotty and friends](https://gilmi.me/blog/post/2021/01/15/bulletin-app) by Gil Mizrahi
  > After writing my blog post on building a bulletin board, I decided spend a couple of weeks and build something a bit more featureful to serve as an example of doing something a bit more complex with scotty.

- [Capturing call stack with Haskell exceptions](https://maksbotan.github.io/posts/2021-01-20-callstacks.html) by Maxim Koltsov
  > Recently I discovered a nice way to capture call stack in Haskell exceptions almost transparently, and I'm going to share it in this post.

- [Choosing Haskell isn't a stand-in for good software design](https://ozataman.medium.com/choosing-haskell-isnt-a-stand-in-for-good-software-design-7d893882f963) by Ozgun Ataman
  > Haskell, or any other particular language for that matter, does not automatically solve all problems related to architecture and macro-level decision-making in software production.

- [GHC 2021 proposal accepted](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/0827f6bfc686a5388ec381107b8178bb4d684edd/proposals/0380-ghc2021.rst) by Joachim Breitner
  > The `GHC20xx` process proposal motivates why we feel the need for `GHC20xx` extensions in general. `GHC2021` is the first iteration of this process, which makes it a bit special.

- [GSoC 2020 Ideas](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html) by Summer of Haskell
  > This is a list of ideas for students who are considering to apply to Google Summer of Code 2021 for Haskell.org.

- [IPFS on Hackage](https://blog.fission.codes/ipfs-on-hackage/) by Daniel Holmgren
  > We just published version 1.0.0 of our IPFS package on Hackage. This library offers a high level API for interacting with IPFS nodes.

- [Maybe Overuse, Stories About Error Information Loss](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2021-01-17-maybe-overuse.html) by Robert Peszek
  > Maybe is the functional answer to null - the billion dollar mistake. I claim that using Maybe can still be problematic.

- [Panel: Dependent Types - salvation or plague?](https://www.airmeet.com/e/4d96c880-5982-11eb-ac04-6124f038041d) by John Hughes
  > Final preparations for Lambda Days 2021 are in full swing! You can have a taste of the February event by joining our completely free and open meetup.

## In brief

- [Beginners Series Updated!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2021/1/18/beginners-series-updated) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Where has Monday Morning Haskell been? Well, to ring in 2021, we've been making some big improvements to the permanent content on the site.

- [Defunctionalizing dependent type families in Haskell](https://blog.poisson.chat/posts/2021-01-16-dependent-fcfs.html) by Li-yao Xia
  > The challenge we'll face in this post is to do type-level pattern-matching on GADTs indexed by type families.

- [EDE a template engine](https://qnikst.brick.do/2021-01-17_ede_a_template_engine) by Alexander Vershilov
  > Today I want to describe the library we use at work and why do I use that.

  > In this episode, Roman Cheplyaka talks to Zubin Duggal who contributed to HLS for years, personally, through various Summer of Code projects and recently as a Tweag Open Source Fellow.

- [How whitespace works in Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKpPJV0hhCY) by Richard Eisenberg

- [Teaching Haskell means teaching important concepts](https://www.lambdabytes.io/posts/teachinghaskell/) by Jonathan Thaler
  > Why did I decide for Haskell and not Python, JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), Scala, Erlang, Rust, Your Favourite Programming Language?

- [Towards Hoare logic for a small imperative language in Haskell](https://bor0.wordpress.com/2021/01/18/towards-hoare-logic-for-a-small-imperative-language-in-haskell/) by Boro Sitnikovski
