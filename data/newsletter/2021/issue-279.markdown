Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [GHC 8.10.7 is now available](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20210827-ghc-8.10.7-released.html) by Zubin Duggal
    > The GHC team is very pleased to announce the availability of GHC 8.10.7. This is a small bugfix release, fixing one linking portability issue present in GHC 8.10.5 and GHC 8.10.6 on some x86_64 macOS toolchains.

<!-- 2021-08-26 through 2021-09-09 -->
-   [Haskell Love Conference](https://haskell.love)
    > If you're ready to take your Haskell skills to the next level and you still haven't made plans, register now to join us on September 10th.

-   [Announcing the new IHP Developer Subscription + IHP v0.14](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/blog/6392ad84-e96a-46ce-9ab5-1d9523d48b23-announcing-the-new-ihp-developer-subscription-ihp-v0-14) by Marc Scholten
    > Today I'm happy to announce the new IHP Pro and IHP Business plans together with the release of IHP v0.14.

-   [Dependency Analysis of Haskell Declarations](https://serokell.io/blog/dependency-analysis-haskell) by Artem Kuznetsov
    > Haskell is one of the few languages that let you structure your program how you see fit. Functions and data types can be declared and used in arbitrary order.

-   [Dependent Types are a Runtime Maybe](https://softwaresimply.blogspot.com/2021/08/dependent-types-are-runtime-maybe.html) by Doug Beardsley
    > Awhile back I was discussing dependent types with someone and we ended up concluding that dependent types can always be replaced by a runtime Maybe.

-   [`forall`](https://github.com/wasp-lang/haskell-handbook/blob/c642dd2e51d7d7612526156b20e75a3ba4ab9f1a/forall.md) by Martin Šošić
    > While normaly forall plays a role of the "universal quantifier", it can also play a role of the "existential quantifier" (depends on the situation). What does all this mean and how can `forall` be used in Haskell? Read on to find out!

-   [Naming function arguments in Dhall](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/08/naming-function-arguments-in-dhall.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
    > This post showcases some neat Dhall language features for improving the readability of types that I think other languages should steal.

-   [Nascent GHC Proposal: Source Rewrite Rules and Optional Constraints](https://cdsmithus.medium.com/nascent-ghc-proposal-source-rewrite-rules-and-optional-constraints-810a2f6051eb) by Chris Smith
    > Lately, I've been thinking more and more about something that would be nice to have in GHC.
