Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [How To Use a Record Field Name Within a Haskell Module Twice](https://lambdablob.com/posts/haskell-duplicate-record-fields-extension/) by Malte Neuss

- [Graphula](https://tech.freckle.com/2021/11/01/graphula/) by Patrick Brisbin
  > Its responsibility is to define and insert arbitrary values and their relations into the database ahead of running a test, while giving you control to tailor the data for that test's needs, and to keep it all succinct and readable.

- [Haskell in Production: Scarf](https://serokell.io/blog/how-scarf-uses-haskell) by Gints Dreimanis
  > In this edition of our Haskell in Production series, I interview Avi Press, the CEO & co-founder of Scarf. In the interview, we talk about where Scarf uses Haskell in their projects and what have been the benefits and downsides of the language choice.

- [A Haskell memory leak in way too much detail with Cachegrind](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-11-04-haskell-profiling-cachegrind/) by Jeffrey Young
  > So, if you're interested in low-level optimization of your Haskell programs then this article is for you. I'll demonstrate the use of a valgrind tool, cachegrind, to inspect the behavior of the canonical leaky Haskell program: a lazy left fold.

- [Simple, type-safe string formatting in Haskell](https://danso.ca/blog/type-safe-printf/) by Dan Soucy
  > Years ago, on a distant website, Lennart Augustsson responded to a question about how printf can work in Haskell, and whether it is type-safe: You can only get a type safe printf using dependent types.

- [A Static Haskell/Reflex Frontend App](http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2021/11/09/a_static_haskell_reflex_frontend_app/) by Jack Kelly
  > Over the past couple of days, I built my first static frontend application using reflex. It's called CASAAAAA (try it out), and it's an interactive fuzzy searcher for aviation terms.
