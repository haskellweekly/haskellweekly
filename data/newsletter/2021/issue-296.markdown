Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [GHC 9.0.2 is now available](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20211225-ghc-9.0.2-released.html) by Zubin Duggal
  > The GHC developers are very happy to at long last announce the availability of GHC 9.0.2. GHC 9.0.2 adds first class AArch64/Darwin support using the LLVM backend, as well as fixing a number of critical correctness bugs with the 9.0.1 release, along with numerous improvements to compiler performance and memory usage.

- [text-2.0 with UTF8 is finally released!](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rnssrw/text20_with_utf8_is_finally_released/) by Andrew Lelechenko
  > I'm happy to announce that `text-2.0` with UTF-8 underlying representation has been finally released.

- [Fast Counting with PostgreSQL and Haskell](https://jezenthomas.com/fast-counting-with-postgresql-and-haskell/) by Jezen Thomas
  > Ideally, the system should give the user a hint of the size of the result set. If there are too many results, they can apply more filters to narrow their search. Too few, vice versa.

- [Haskell Coverage Reports](https://pbrisbin.com/posts/haskell-coverage-reports/) by Patrick Brisbin
  > This post describes how to track test coverage in a Haskell project and utilize just such information in Pull Requests.

- [Implementing a Functional Language with Graph Reduction](https://thma.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-Implementing-a-functional-language-with-Graph-Reduction.html) by Thomas Mahler
  > Implementing a small functional language with a classic combinator based graph-reduction machine in Haskell.

- [Static HTTP share with S3 and Haskell](https://www.anardil.net/2021/static-http-share-with-s3-and-haskell.html) by Austin Voecks
  > The solution for me is a Haskell program, indexer, to pre-generate index pages for my data and upload that along side the content in S3.
