Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Aeson Object Design (Part 4)](https://www.extrema.is/blog/2021/09/18/aeson-object-design-part-4) by Travis Cardwell
    > In Aeson Object Design (Part 2), I explored the cost of representing objects with various data structures. Today, I created the benchmarks for the normal scenario.

-   [Automatically updated, cached views with lens](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2021/09/17/automatically-updated-cached-views-with-lens/) by Brent Yorgey
    > Recently I discovered a nice way to deal with records where certain fields of the record cache some expensive function of other fields, using the `lens` library.

-   [Browse Hackage from the terminal](https://lazamar.github.io/haskell-documentation-in-the-command-line/) by Marcelo Lazaroni
    > The Haskell ecosystem has great facilities for searching and navigating package documentation using the browser. `haskell-docs-cli` allows you to do that much faster without leaving the terminal.

-   [Implementing Co, a Small Interpreted Language With Coroutines #2: The Interpreter](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/implementing-co-2/) by Abhinav Sarkar
    > The previous post was all about the syntax of Co. In this post we dive into the semantics of Co, and write an interpreter for its basic features.

-   [Learning Haskell by building a static blog generator](https://soupi.github.io/learn-haskell-blog-generator/) by Gil Mizrahi
    > In this book we will implement a simple static blog generator in Haskell, converting documents written in our own custom markup language to HTML.
