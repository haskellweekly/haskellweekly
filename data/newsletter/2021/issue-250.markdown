## In brief

- [Configuring Cabal build flags](https://blog.shaynefletcher.org/2021/02/configuring-cabal-build-flags.html) by Shayne Fletcher
  > Sometimes it's desirable to force the situation though and explicitly make them do one or the other. How you do that?

- [Consuming JSON API Data with Haskell](https://bitsbybrad.com/2021-02-09-json-api-haskell/) by Brad Sherman
  > In this post I'll walk through how we can write a bit of Haskell code to consume JSON data from this API.

- [Extensible Record in Haskell using Vinyl for Noob](https://dev.to/soriyeak/extensible-record-in-haskell-using-vinyl-for-noob-1l65)
  > In this tutorial, I'm going to show how to use `vinyl` to create an extensible record within haskell.

- [Folds are constructor substitution](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/02/folds-are-constructor-substitution.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > I notice that functional programming beginners and experts understand the word "fold" to mean subtly different things, so I'd like to explain what experienced functional programmers usually mean when they use the term "fold".

- [Haskell On Google Cloud Is Great](https://alistairb.dev/haskell-on-google-cloud-is-great/) by Alistair Burrowes
  > Haskell on GCP is great. GCP vs AWS has various trade offs, however I think there are a few reasons why GCP is great for Haskell.

- [High-performance JSON codec](https://z.haskell.world/performance/2021/02/01/High-performance-JSON-codec.html) by Han Dong Zhu
  > With careful optimization, we managed to get a 1.5X - 3X encoding and 3X decoding performance boost comparing to aeson, a widely used JSON package on hackage.

- [Integrating refinement and dependent types: a fellowship report](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-02-05-refinement-types/) by Georg Rudoy
  > This post is about compiling refinement types into a dependently typed core language, my project as an Open Source Fellow for Tweag.

- [Rust for Haskell Programmers!](https://mmhaskell.com/rust) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > In this series, we'll learn the basics of Rust, coming from the perspective of Haskell programmers.

- [Type Applications](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/37.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Come `@` me bro! In this episode we review Zac Wood's post about the type applications language extension.

- [-XFunctorialDo](https://abooij.blogspot.com/2021/02/xfunctorialdo.html) by Auke Booij
  > `ApplicativeDo` is useful also for functors. However, use laziness when pattern matching.
