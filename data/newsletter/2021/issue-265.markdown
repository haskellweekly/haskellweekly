Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [A combinator library for taxes](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-05-23-tax-combinators.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > In this post I describe and demonstrate the Haskell tax library, which provides data types and combinators for defining taxes.

- [Fix(ity) me](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/fixity) by Dmitrii Kovanikov & Veronika Romashkina
  > To get a deeper understanding of the problem and develop firefighting techniques, let's have a closer look at operators and how to work with them. This post is useful for both newcomers and language adepts, seeking ground rules around using operators and must-do things when introducing your own operators.

- [Haskell on Actions, Part 3](https://tech.freckle.com/2021/05/21/haskell-on-actions-part-3/) by Patrick Brisbin
  > In this post, we'll talk about Docker-based deployment of a Haskell project. Really, this applies to any compiled project, where careful layers, multi-stage builds, and layer caching on CI is important.

- [Imagine compiler internals - a story](https://www.imagine.ai/blog/imagine-compiler-internals) by Manu Gunther & Ale Gadea
  > Haskell allows us to implement a well modularized compiler, with separate phases in which the abstract representation of the input is the most important component.

- [State of the Cabal](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/state-of-the-cabal-q1-q2-2021/2548?u=taylorfausak) by Emily Pillmore
  > This announcement will detail some updates to the team, as well as the direction we want to take in the future to make Cabal a friendlier library and tooling system to work with.

- [Tying the Knot in Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/tying-the-knot-haskell/) by Michael Snoyman
  > This post has nothing to do with marriage. Tying the knot is, in my opinion at least, a relatively obscure technique you can use in Haskell to address certain corner cases.

- [What good is metaprogramming, anyway?](https://www.patreon.com/posts/51543413) by Sandy Maguire
  > Something that's annoying in Haskell is writing generic, structurally-inductive functions. Doing this by hand is frustrating; there's a lot of repetition, but there's no good way to automate away the pain.

## In brief

- [Answering my own Template Haskell question](https://jmtd.net/log/answering_myself/) by Jonathan Dowland
  > When I learned that, my sense of oddness about the question remained, so I went to find the original thread, to discover I wrote the original question a year ago and had therefore literally answered my own question a year later.

- [Haskell: Applicative](https://cstml.github.io/2021/05/23/applicative.html) by Vlad Posmangiu Luchian
  > An Applicative is short for a strong lax monoidal functor or some people might call it an Applicative Functor.

- [Module Organization Guidelines](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/46.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > Should you organize modules vertically or horizontally? This week we take a look at another article by Gabriella Gonzalez, this time about organizing projects and packages.
