Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Making LLVM GEP safer in Haskell](https://luctielen.com/posts/making_llvm_gep_safer_in_haskell/) by Luc Tielen
  > In today's article, I will showcase how Haskell's typesystem can be used to simplify code generation and reduce the chance of bugs involving the LLVM getelementptr instruction.

- [Adventures in Looping](https://blog.drewolson.org/adventures-in-looping) by Drew Olson
  > The core of the Slack integration was a never-ending loop that read messages from a web socket and performed actions based on the message. But how should I go about looping forever in Haskell?

- [Can you make heterogeneous lists in Haskell? Sure --- as long your intent is clear](https://laurentrdc.xyz/posts/existential.html) by Laurent P. RenÃ© de Cotret
  > In this post, I'll show you how to do something like this using the `ExistentialQuantification` language extension.

- [Fall-from-Grace: A ready-to-fork functional programming language](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/09/fall-from-grace-ready-to-fork.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > The goal of this language is to improve the quality of domain-specific languages by providing a useful starting point for implementers to fork and build upon.

- [Haskell.org GSoC results for 2021](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2021-09-23-final-results.html) by Jasper Van der Jeugt
  > All our 10 slots were successful! This is the first that has happened in the history of Haskell.org's participation in the program. Some of these are high-profile and will benefit a lot of users in the ecosystem, which is super exciting.

- [Nested strict data in Haskell](http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/nested-strict-data/) by Tom Ellis
  > In this article I;ll explain how the approaches work, what they leave to be desired, and a suggest a reasonably general alternative. The alternative seems lightweight enough for Haskell programmers to adopt when they define strict data structures.

- [A Short Overview of Typed Template Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/typed-template-haskell-overview) by Heitor Toledo Lassarote de Paula
  > Today we will take a quick look at typed Template Haskell. This article assumes some familiarity with Template Haskell (TH) already.

- [Swarm: preview and call for collaboration](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2021/09/23/swarm-preview-and-call-for-collaboration/) by Brent Yorgey
  > For about a month now I have been working on building a game, tentatively titled Swarm. It's nowhere near finished, but it has at least reached a point where I'm not embarrassed to show it off.

- [Using lens to set a value based on another](https://magnus.therning.org/2021-09-28-using-lens-to-set-a-value-based-on-another.html) by Magnus Therning
  > It did make me wonder if this kind of problem, setting a value based on another value, isn't so common that there's a nicer solution to it.
