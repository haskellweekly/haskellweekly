Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Arrows Zoo](https://kowainik.github.io/posts/arrows-zoo) by Veronika Romashkina
  > Don't know about you, folks, but I had a hard time remembering all the Haskell arrows that you can bump into in all different situations.

- [Building a Web app with FP - Part I - Servant](https://matsumonkie.fr/post/1/) by Iori Matsuhara
  > I believe the world of Functional Programming can sometimes be a bit obscure and frustrating for beginners, so I hope this series will help you into your path towards loving Functional Programming

- [Building REST from GraphQL - a story of engineering in Haskell](https://hasura.io/blog/building-rest-from-graphql-story-of-engineering-haskell/) by Lyndon Maydwell
  > Recently our team delivered a new Hasura feature and the experience was one of those moments where you ask yourself - Why can't it always be like this?

- [Go straight to STM](https://joyofhaskell.com/posts/2021-02-24-why-stm.html) by Chris Martin
  > Everybody wants to know. Does Haskell have mutable state? Yes! In fact, several different kinds --- IORef, MVar, TVar --- that have various tradeoffs depending on... Ugh.

- [Haskell Executable Sizes](https://dfithian.github.io/2021/02/28/haskell-executable-sizes.html) by Dan Fithian
  > This post is an experiment with reducing Haskell executable sizes.

- [nix-script](https://bytes.zone/posts/nix-script/) by Brian Hicks
  > Well, that works, but I've traded speed for flexibility: run time has grown to over 2 seconds! Eep! I don't think I should have to make this trade, so I wrote `nix-script`.

- [PureScript 0.14 Released](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/purescript-0-14-released/2148) by Thomas Honeyman
  > PureScript 0.14 introduces many improvements to the compiler, documentation, and core libraries. It also introduces two new features to the language: polymorphic kinds and safe zero-cost coercions!

- [Watching changes in Yesod](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2021-02-27-watching-changes-in-yesod) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > The idea of the feedback loop is to be able answer the question "am I done?" as quickly as possible. The shorter this loop is, the quicker you can iterate.

- [Why you should use IHP instead of express](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/ShowPost?postId=f2009021-f235-4d7e-ae9d-6309ac5f6049) by Jannis Jorre
  > If `undefined` errors, configuration messes, hours of hunting bugs annoy you as much as it annoys us, now's the perfect time to try out IHP.

## In brief

- [Using Nix for Haskell development in Emacs with LSP](https://jcodev.eu/posts/using-nix-for-haskell-development-in-emacs-with-lsp/) by Jonas Collberg
  > This article covers basic setup of development environment for Haskell in Emacs, using `lsp-mode`.

- [Where Lions Roam: RISC-V on the VELDT](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/luu4m0/where_lions_roam_riscv_on_the_veldt/) by David Cox
  > I am excited to announce the release of Lion, a formally verified, 5-stage pipeline RISC-V core. Lion is written using Clash and available on Hackage as a library so that users may create their own System-on-Chip (SoC) around the Lion core.
