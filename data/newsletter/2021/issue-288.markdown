Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Survey

## In brief

- [7 Useful Tools Written in Haskell](https://typeable.io/blog/2021-10-18-haskell-tools) by Nikolay Rulev
  > Though Haskell is already quite widely used in the industry, it's still sometimes believed to be an "academical" language used exclusively for scientific purposes. In this post, I'd like to tell you about several rather popular Haskell tools which may be of use to you.

- [Competitive programming in Haskell: BFS, part 3 (implementation via HashMap)](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2021/10/29/competitive-programming-in-haskell-bfs-part-3-implementation-via-hashmap/) by Brent Yorgey

- [Why Haskell](https://www.costarastrology.com/why-haskell) by Co-Star
  > We currently have exactly two backend engineers. A single Haskell engineer can support a 2:3+:1 data:FE:BE developer ratio and still have free BE time.
