Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Haskell series part 5](https://blog.kalvad.com/haskell-series-part-5/) by Pierre Guillemot
  > This is the fifth article of a series on the functional language Haskell for beginners. In this article we are covering pattern matching and guards.

- [Tuple Prelude](https://vitez.me/tuple-prelude) by Mitchell Vitez
  > A Template Haskell Adventure

- [Clang-based GHC 9, done easy](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/clang-based-ghc-9-done-easy/3387?u=taylorfausak) by Koz Ross
  > For various reasons, you might want a Clang-based GHC on a platform where Clang is not the default compiler.

- [`Data.Map.Strict.Map` is not a strict map](http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/data-map-strict-map-not-strict-map/) by Tom Ellis
  > I was surprised when I learned that `Data.Map.Strict.Map` is not strict. Its laziness has serious consequences for attempts at space leak free programming in Haskell.

- [Episode 2: Lennart Augustsson](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1817535/9286902-02-lennart-augustsson) by The Haskell Interlude
  > The guest in our second episode is Lennart Augustsson. The hosts are Wouter Swierstra and Niki Vazou. We talk about Lennart's long history with Haskell, about the various jobs he has had, all the compilers he has written, and about dependent types.

- [Haskell Foundation September Seven Month Update Extravaganza](https://haskell-foundation.medium.com/haskell-foundation-september-seven-month-update-extravaganza-f1533862f1e7) by Andrew Boardman
  > We want to improve and become more effective, so in this monthly update let's dive into what we've done over the last seven months, what we've learned, and where we want to go.

- [Porting to Polysemy](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/porting-to-polysemy/index.html) by Sandy Maguire
  > I wanted to spend some time today discussing how to actually go about Polysemizing a codebase. It's not too onerous if you proceed cautiously.

- [Releasing QUIC and HTTP/3 libraries](https://kazu-yamamoto.hatenablog.jp/entry/2021/10/04/153546) by Kazu Yamamoto
  > As I described in The Current Plan for Haskell QUIC, I have released the followings: tls, http2, quic, http3, warp-quic, mighttpd2.

- [The "return a command" trick](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/10/the-return-command-trick.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > This post illustrates a trick that I've taught a few times to minimize the "change surface" of a Haskell program. By "change surface" I mean the number of places Haskell code needs to be updated when adding a new feature.

- [Soft Compatibility](https://blog.hetchr.com/soft-compatibility/) by Gautier di Folco
  > After few weeks of work, we released GitLab support last week. We previously integrated GitHub, so we expected that GitLab would be roughly the same, and well, expectations set up for disappointment.

## In brief

- [Improving the `typed-process` documentation](http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/improving-the-typed-process-documentation/) by Tom Ellis
