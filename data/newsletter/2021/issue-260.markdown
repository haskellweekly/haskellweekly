Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Of function instances and abstract syntax](https://www.danielbrice.net/blog/of-function-instances-and-abstract-syntax/) by Daniel Brice
  > Some Haskell classes `class Myclass a` admit an instance for functions `instance Myclass a => Myclass (x -> a)` based on the instance for `a`. All of these instances have a few things in common: (1) they implement the class methods in a straightforward way as `mymethod f = \x -> mymethod (f x)`, and (2) they are polarizing among Haskell practitioners. The linked blog post is a case study of why one might find such instances compelling and useful.

- [Arrows, through a different lens](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-04-15-arrows-through-a-different-lens/) by Juan Raphael Diaz Simões
  > My goal in this post is to show how lenses and other optics can be used in Arrow-based workflows. Doing so is greatly simplified thanks to Profunctor optics and some utilities that I helped add to the latest version of the lens library.

- [Checking for uncheckable: optional constraints](https://aadaa-fgtaa.github.io/blog/optionally/)
  > Can we check if an instance exists and acquire its dictionary without defining boilerplate instances by hand, or using template haskell to generate them?

- [Continued Fractions: Haskell, Equational Reasoning, Property Testing, and Rewrite Rules in Action](https://cdsmithus.medium.com/continued-fractions-haskell-equational-reasoning-property-testing-and-rewrite-rules-in-action-77a16d750e3f) by Chris Smith
  > In this article, we'll develop a Haskell library for continued fractions. Continued fractions are a different representation for real numbers, besides the fractions and decimals we all learned about in grade school.

- [Functional Flocks](https://ec-jones.github.io/flocking.html) by Eddie Jones
  > Monads have been widely adopted in the functional programming community, but their dual, co-monads, are sadly not so popular.

- [Hacking on GHC - First Steps](https://cptwunderlich.github.io/2021/04/21/ghc-hacking-first-steps.html) by Benjamin Maurer
  > That's why I've decided to write about my experience - maybe someone will find the solution to a problem here or get motivated to start hacking on GHC!

- [Poltergeist Types](https://gallais.github.io/blog/poltergeist-types) by Guillaume Allais
  > Phantom types are a well-known compile-time tool to ensure that illegal actions (such as attempting to write in a read-only file) are unrepresentable. In this blog post we introduce poltergeist types: phantom types whose parameters may still knock around at runtime.

- [A Random Tour of Typeclass in Haskell](https://medium.com/geekculture/a-random-tour-of-typeclass-in-haskell-87a5a2125e1a) by Ong Yi Ren
  > This article is inspired by Vitaly Bragilevsky's talk on The clear path to Haskell complexities. This is not a Monad tutorial.

- [Type Families in Haskell: The Definitive Guide](https://serokell.io/blog/type-families-haskell) by Vladislav Zavialov
  > Type families are one of the most powerful type-level programming features in Haskell. You can think of them as type-level functions, but that doesn't really cover the whole picture. By the end of this article, you will know what they are exactly and how to use them.

- [What I wish somebody told me when I was learning Haskell](https://www.poberezkin.com/posts/2021-04-21-what-i-wish-somebody-told-me-when-i-was-learning-Haskell.html) by Evgeny Poberezkin
  > I tried to convert this rant into the collection of ideas that I hope could help both the people who are just starting to learn Haskell and, maybe, some of those who are getting through the advanced levels.

## In brief

- [Default Exception Handlers](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/43.html) by Haskell Weekly Podcast
  > What happens to exceptions when you don't explicitly handle them? This week we review Taylor's blog post about default exception handlers.

- [The end of history for programming](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/04/the-end-of-history-for-programming.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > I spend quite a bit of time thinking about what the end of history for programming might look like. By the "end of history" I mean the point beyond which programming paradigms would not evolve significantly.

- [Global IORef in Template Haskell](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2021/04/21/global_ioref_in_template_haskell.html) by Matt Parsons
  > One of the potential solutions involves persisting some global state across module boundaries. I decided to investigate whether the "Global IORef Trick" would work for this.
