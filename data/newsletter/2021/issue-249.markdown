Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

- [Dynamic type errors lack relevance](https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/01/dynamic-type-errors-lack-relevance.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > The fundamental issue is that in a dynamically typed language you cannot explain errors to the user in terms of the source code they wrote.

- [Fuzzing me wrong --- How QuickCheck destroyed my favourite theory](https://thma.github.io/posts/2021-01-30-How-QuickCheck-destroyed-my-favourite-theory.html) by Thomas Mahler
  > I was impressed with the power of QuickCheck, so I thought it would be a good idea to share this lesson in falsification.

- [Haskell's @ symbol - Type Application](https://zacwood.me/posts/haskell-type-application/) by Zac Wood
  > One the the first nonstandard language extensions you'll come across while developing with IHP is the fancy `@` symbol.

- [Memory Fragmentation: A Deeper Look With ghc-debug](https://well-typed.com/blog/2021/01/fragmentation-deeper-look/) by Matthew Pickering & David Eichmann
  > In this post we will report on our progress implementing ghc-debug, a tool for performing precise heap analysis, and how we have used it in order to pinpoint the cause of the fragmentation issues.

- [New random interface](https://alexey.kuleshevi.ch/blog/2021/01/29/random-interface/) by Alexey Kuleshevich
  > This post is about the new cool features in random-1.2.0. Most notably performance improvements and the new monadic stateful interface.

- [Prototyping a plugin system for Purebred](https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-fp/posts/2021-02-02-plugin-system-prototype.html) by Fraser Tweedale
  > In this post I present an experimental design for a plugin system, where plugins' capabilities are expressed in their types.

- [Singleton](https://typeclasses.com/featured/singleton) by Type Classes
  > Why is it that `Data.Sequence` has a `singleton` function and `Data.List` does not?
