Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Assessing Haskell](https://nyeogmi.com/2021/11/30/assessing-haskell/) by Nyeogmi
  > I considered trying to assess Haskell without mentioning my own opinions at all. I don't think that's fair or possible, nor do I think that would lead people to an accurate assessment of Haskell.

- [Fallback of actions](https://magnus.therning.org/2021-11-27-fallback-of-actions.html) by Magnus Therning
  > In a tool I'm writing I want to load a file that may reside on the local disk, but if it isn't there I want to fetch it from the web. Basically it's very similar to having a cache and dealing with a miss, except in my case I don't populate the cache.

- [Flora.pm --- An alternative package index for Haskell](https://ko-fi.com/post/Dev-blog-Flora-pm-An-alternative-package-index-X8X477DXT) by Théophile Choutri
  > For a little less than a month now, I have been working on a fantastic project: An alternative package index for the Haskell ecosystem: Flora.

- [Jet - A Structural JSON editor](https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet/tree/4dc00e9bc58a6df522afd1742a6786a762af508a) by Chris Penner
  > I.e. an editor which is aware of the structure of JSON and allows you to manipulate it directly. The document is always in a valid state.

- [Learn Haskell by building a blog generator](https://lhbg-book.link) by Gil Mizrahi
  > In this book we will implement a simple static blog generator in Haskell, converting documents written in our own custom markup language to HTML.

- [`RankNTypes` via Lambda Calculus](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2021/11/30/rank_n_types_via_lambda_calculus.html) by Matt Parsons
  > The most basic explanation is that it allows the _implementer_ of a function to pick a type, rather than the _caller_ of the function.

- [See and Believe: Visualizing with Gloss](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2021/11/29/see-and-believe-visualizing-with-gloss) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Writing abstract algorithms isn't as interesting as seeing them in action. So this week I'll re-introduce Gloss, a really neat framework I've used to make some simple games in Haskell.

- [The varieties of the Haskelling experience](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2021-11-25-varieties-of-haskelling-experience/) by Noon van der Silk
  > Recently, a group of Haskellers within Tweag had a knowledge-sharing event where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some nice tricks and tips for every-day life.

- [What's That Typeclass: Foldable](https://serokell.io/blog/whats-that-typeclass-foldable) by Alyona Antonova
  > These two functions are core methods of the `Foldable` type class, about which we are going to learn in this article.

## In brief

- [Announcing `genvalidity-1.0.0.0`](https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2021-11-26-genvalidity) by Tom Sydney Kerckhove
  > This post announces the latest `1.0.0.0` release of `genvalidity` and all its companion packages. It re-introduces validity-based testing and elaborates on the choices that went into the new release.

- [Call for Haskell.org Committee Nominations](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/call-for-haskell-org-committee-nominations/3758?u=taylorfausak) by Jasper Van der Jeugt
  > It is time to put out a call for new nominations (as usual, self-nominations and re-nominations are also welcome) for the Haskell.org committee.

- [Episode 6: Graham Hutton](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/6/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Graham Hutton is interviewed by Wouter Swierstra and Andres Löh. Graham is known for his work on Haskell both in research and teaching Haskell, and in particular his Haskell book.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (December 2021)](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/r6dnmn/monthly_hask_anything_december_2021/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

- [The !-modality Is a Comonad](http://blog.vmchale.com/article/exponential-modality) by Vanessa McHale
  > In particular, it is a functor; we can lift any function/procedure to work on perennial types with `map`.
