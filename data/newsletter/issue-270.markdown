- [Typed Programs Don't Leak Data](https://dodisturb.me/posts/2021-06-27-Typed-Programs-Dont-Leak-Data.html) by Mistral Contrastin
  > In which we turn privacy violations into compile-time errors in a simple imperative language embedded in Haskell and enforce it in style using GADTs.

- [Arming polysemy with Arrows](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2021-06-28-polysemy-arrows.html) by Robert Peszek
  > The goal of this post is to show how to use arrows when working with or creating polysemy effects.

- [Associated Types In Two Different Ways](https://morrowm.github.io/posts/2021-06-26-assoc.html) by Morrow
  > Suppose you wanted to write a type class for indexable containers. But now, we decide that we also want to be able to index `Map`s as well. The issue is that we've already hard-coded the index type to be `Int`.

- [Functors and Monads For People Who Have Read Too Many "Tutorials"](http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2958) by Jeremy Bowers
  > This may not be the best place to learn about these concepts for the first time, because I'm going to focus on knocking down the misconceptions about them. Then again, it may not be the worst place, for the same reason.

- [The tail of an off-by-one error in GHC's linker](https://log.zw3rk.com/posts/2021-06-28-off-by-one/) by Moritz Angermann
  > This is the story of an odd off-by-one error in GHC's internal static linker for the Mach-O file format on AArch64. This is our beloved macOS/iOS platform!

- [Towers of Hanoi from a Random Start](https://cdsmithus.medium.com/towers-of-hanoi-from-a-random-start-db22d09da027) by Chris Smith
  > Lately, I've been pondering the case where, instead of starting with all disks in the first tower, we start with some arbitrary starting configuration. What can we say about this problem?
