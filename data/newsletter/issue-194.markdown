Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Call for Ideas for 2020](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2020-01-12-call-for-ideas.html) by Summer of Haskell
  > If you are the maintainer or a user of a Haskell project, and you have an improvement in mind which a student could work on during the summer, please submit an idea.

- [Static types are dangerously interesting](https://alexnixon.github.io/2020/01/14/static-types-are-dangerous.html) by Alex Nixon
  > This post will take you through a tiny, real-world example, showing how you can use static types to swap one problem for another.

- [Adjunctions in the wild: foldl](https://blog.jle.im/entry/foldl-adjunction.html) by Justin Le
  > The goal is to show how much this example made me further appreciate the conceptual idea of adjunctions and how they can pop up in interesting places in practical libraries.

- [The road to proficient Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-01-11-road-to-proficient.html) by William Yao
  > Here’s my recommendation about what resources and exercises to use for each step. May it help you on your path to proficiency.

- [Using Cabal on its Own](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2020/1/13/using-cabal-on-its-own) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > We can use Cabal in a standalone fashion, as Haskell developers did for years. This week, we'll explore what this looks like. We'll encounter the problems that ultimately led to the development of Stack.

- [Common stanzas](https://vrom911.github.io/blog/common-stanzas) by Veronika Romashkina
  > I would like to discuss one specific feature of Cabal — common stanzas, explain its mission and demonstrate how it could be used, which problems it helps to avoid, and also mention some widely used alternatives.

- [Generating small binaries in Haskell](https://dixonary.co.uk/blog/haskell/small) by Alex Dixon
  > I've been mulling over the biggest problem that microcosmos has: It's huge. To be precsise, it's 113MB once compiled.

- [Digging into Lenses](https://deontologician.com/wiki/lenses/) by Josh Kuhn
  > In order to understand the haskell lens library better, I recently dug into some of the underlying types involved.

## Jobs

- [Interos is Hiring Full Stack Haskell Software Engineers](https://www.interos.ai/careers/#haskell-software-engineer-ii) (ad)
  > At Interos, we are disrupting the way Fortune 500 companies and government agencies identify and respond to risk within their supply chains. We deliver the data and insights to business leaders that help them identify, visualize and understand the ripple effects that could impact their supply chains, before they happen. Recently funded by Kleiner Perkins and pivoting to an automated solution, Interos is in essence, a start-up SaaS environment.

## In brief

- [Gain confidence with Haskell!](https://cswithbaddrawings.wordpress.com/2020/01/10/gain-confidence-with-haskell/) by Brandon
  > Why would I reach for Haskell, when Python is easy enough to understand and use? What Haskell provides, in my opinion, is confidence in my code.

- [Haskell.org GSoC results for 2019](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2020-01-10-final-results.html) by Summer of Haskell
  > Haskell.org took part in Google Summer of Code again in 2019, and we had some really successful projects!
