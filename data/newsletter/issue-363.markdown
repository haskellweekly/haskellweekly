Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Anagrams kata as a one-liner](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2023/04/10/anagrams-kata-as-a-one-liner/) by Mark Seemann
  > I thought it would be fun to redo the exercise in Haskell and see how compact code I could get away with.

- [Competitive programming in Haskell: topsort via laziness](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2023/04/11/competitive-programming-in-haskell-topsort-via-laziness/) by Brent Yorgey
  > In this problem, we have a directed acyclic graph where each vertex represents a person, and there is an edge `p -> q` when person `p` sends their finished envelopes to person `q`.

- [Haskell: The Free Boolean Cube](https://apotheca.io/articles/Free-Boolean-Cube.html) by Leo
  > There's a concept that I've been working with lately that I've taken to calling 'the free boolean cube'. If you're familiar with the lambda cube, you'll find this to be similar, albeit about different things.

- [How to Make ChatGPT Go Around in Circles (with GHC and Haskell)](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2023/4/10/how-to-make-chatgpt-go-around-in-circles-ghc) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Can I use GHC to compile a Haskell module without its dependent source files?

- [IOG GHC Update #7](https://engineering.iog.io/2023-04-06-ghc-update/) by IOG
  > Biweekly update from the GHC DevX team at IOG.

- [Pedagogical Downsides of Haskell](https://ciobaca.substack.com/p/pedagogical-downsides-of-haskell) by Stefan Ciobaca
  > I still think Haskell is one of the best ways to teach functional programming. In any case, the issues below are difficulties in teaching and learning Haskell.

- [Using Literate Haskell with Jekyll](https://nicolast.be/various/jekyll-literate-haskell/) by Nicolas Trangez
  > When writing technical articles including code examples, as an author I want to make sure these examples are correct, i.e., they compile cleanly and, ideally, some tests pass.

## In brief

- [Announcing new YouTube series: The Haskell Unfolder](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/04/announcing-the-haskell-unfolder/) by Edsko de Vries & Andres Löh
  > In each episode, we will discuss technical topics around programming in Haskell. Topics range from beginner-friendly to advanced and --- once in a while --- esoteric.

- [Episode 24: Jeremy Gibbons](https://haskell.foundation/podcast/24/) by The Haskell Interlude
  > Jeremy Gibbons is professor at Oxford and talks about his journey from Orwell to Haskell, how to teach Haskell and specification languages to undergraduates as well as professional programmers, how programming languages should keep simple things simple, and how paper writing can or even should be like poetry.

- [GHC WebAssembly Weekly Update, 2023-04-12](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-webassembly-weekly-update-2023-04-12/6140?u=taylorfausak) by Cheng Shao

- [Haskell Foundation March 2023 Update](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-march-2023-update/6141?u=taylorfausak) by David Christiansen

## Show & tell

- [canadian-income-tax](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/a-command-line-application-written-in-haskell-for-canadian-taxes/6123?u=taylorfausak) by Mario Blažević
  > This package provides a library and executable to fill out incomplete Canadian tax forms in FDF format and to populate all fields therein that can be automatically calculated from the rest of the form.

- [data-forced](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/data-forced-0-1-0-0-released/6136?u=taylorfausak) by Ruben Astudillo
  > This is a library to avoid reference leaks (liveness leaks) on long lived data structures close to main.

- [fcf-containers version 0.8.1](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-fcf-containers-v0-8-1-is-out-with-improved-control-monad-instances/6127?u=taylorfausak)
  > Happy to announce again about the new version!

  > generic-persistence is a Haskell persistence layer for relational databases.

- [Keter version 2.1.0](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/keter-2-1-0-released/6134?u=taylorfausak) by Jappie Klooster
  > A new release for keter is here. This provides a overhaul of the logging system, no longer uses keter its own homegrown system, but it uses monad logger on top of fast-logger instead.

- [ktx-codec version 0.0.2.1](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ktx-codec-0-0-2-1-with-even-more-ktx/6124?u=taylorfausak)
