Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Survey

<!-- Runs from 2022-11-03 to 2022-11-10. -->
- [2022 State of Haskell Survey](https://haskellweekly.news/survey/2022.html) by Haskell Weekly
  > This survey opens on November 1st and closes on the 15th. The goal of this survey is to better understand what people think of the Haskell programming language, together with its ecosystem and community. Whether you have never used Haskell or you use it every day, we want to hear from you!

## Featured

- [GHC 9.4.3 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-4-3-is-now-available/5268?u=taylorfausak) by Ben Gamari
  > The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.4.3. This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few issues found in 9.4.2.

- [GHC 9.2.5 released](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-2-5-released/5275?u=taylorfausak) by Zubin Duggal
  > The GHC developers are very happy to at announce the availability of GHC 9.2.5. This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing a few issues found in 9.2.4.

- [Functional programming from sets and functions](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-11-08-functional-programming-from-sets-and-functions/) by Marco Perone
  > In this post I would like to try a different approach, not requiring any programming knowledge, but only the most basic intuition.

- [Improving the experience of JSON in Haskell with autodocodec and bifunctors](https://www.dylanamartin.com/2022/11/08/improving-the-aeson-experience.html) by Dylan Martin
  > Given the advantages laid out in that discussion, I decided to give that library a try on my project's codebase, and it worked so well that, so I ended up refactoring basically all of my types to use autodocodec to generate JSON parsers for my types.

- [Let's agree to be different. On empirical and deductive nature of coding.](https://rpeszek.github.io/posts/2022-11-07-empirical-programming.html) by Robert Peszek
  > I have convinced myself that programmers tend to favor empirical or favor deductive. I call these camps pragmatists and theorists. This division impacts how we program and communicate.

- [A map of Haskell's numeric types](https://blog.plover.com/prog/haskell/numbers.html) by Mark Dominus
  > I keep getting lost in the maze of Haskell's numeric types. Here's lso the map I drew to help myself out.

- [Recompilation avoidance in `rules_haskell`](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2022-11-03-blog_recompilation/) by Guillaume Genestier
  > In this blog post I explain how I improved recompilation avoidance in `rules_haskell`, a Bazel rule set to build Haskell code.

- [Security assessment by Trail of Bits, the new website and v4.2 released](https://simplex.chat/blog/20221108-simplex-chat-v4.2-security-audit-new-website.html) by Evgeny Poberezkin
  > We have a growing number of enthusiasts using SimpleX Chat who can accept the security risks of unaudited system, but the users who depend on their security were patiently waiting until some independent experts validate our claims.

- [Uniplate is a Traversal](http://jackkelly.name/blog/archives/2022/10/30/uniplate_is_a_traversal/index.html) by Jack Kelly
  > While writing code to rewrite some Dhall syntax trees, I noticed a cool connection between the core uniplate operation and optics.

- [Zoom! Enhance!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/11/7/zoom-enhance) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Today we'll be tackling the Day 20 problem from Advent of Code 2021. This problem is a fun take on the Zoom and Enhance cliche from TV dramas where cops and spies can always seem to get unrealistic details from grainy camera footage by "enhancing" it.
