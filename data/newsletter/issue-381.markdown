Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [A defense of laziness in Haskell, Part 1: Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSqE-HSh_NU) by Alexis King
> Laziness is a critical but often maligned aspect of Haskell, and as this video argues, it is frequently misunderstood.

- [GHC 9.8.1-alpha2 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-9-8-1-alpha2-is-now-available/7258) by Ben Gamari
> The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the availability of the second alpha prerelease of GHC 9.8.1.

- [GHC activities report: June–July 2023](https://well-typed.com/blog/2023/08/ghc-activities-report-june-july-2023/) by Well-Typed
> This is the nineteenth edition of our GHC activities report, which describes the work on GHC and related projects that we are doing at Well-Typed.

- [Haskell Language Server 2.1.0.0 is now available](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-haskell-language-server-2-1-0-0-is-now-available/7272) by Fendor

- [Haskell vs Zombies](https://www.channable.com/tech/haskell-vs-zombies) by Channable
> We wanted to build a system that prevents orphaned subprocesses from escaping, and makes sure terminating a job also terminates all subprocesses that are potentially associated with it.

- [How to learn language extensions](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/how-to-learn-language-extensions/7252)
> I’m relatively new to Haskell (although I was a programmer for 39 years), and I find the way some language extensions are documented to be rather opaque.

- [Important things to know about writing good haskell code](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/important-things-to-know-about-writing-good-haskell-code/7302)
> What do you think is important to know in order to write good Haskell code?

- [The Meaning of Monad in MonadTrans](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2023/08/10/the_meaning_of_monad_in_monadtrans.html) by Matt Parsons
> At work, someone noticed that they got a compiler warning for a derived instance of MonadTrans.

## Jobs

- [Systems Haskell Engineer at SimpleX Chat](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3670109632) (ad)
  > SimpleX Chat is a fully open-source, private and secure messaging platform. It is the first, and it seems the only, messaging network that does not have any kind of user identity in its design (not even random numbers) - it uses anonymous pairwise identifiers instead.

## Show & tell

- [keuringsdienst - Data validation in Haskell with composable rules (monoid)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/keuringsdienst) by Josep Bigorra
> There exist many data validation packages, in Haskell and other languages, but so far I have never found something that was flexible but powerful enough for my needs.

- [Three configurable prettyprinters](https://reasonableapproximation.net/2023/08/10/three-configurable-prettyprinters.html) by Phil Hazelden
> I've been exploring a new-to-me approach to stringification. Except that right now it's three different approaches that broadly share a common goal. I call it/them pretty-gist.

## Call for participation

- [Survey for Visually Impaired Programmers (18+)](https://hde.design/research/dev-vis/) by smm_research
> Are you a software developer/engineer who uses a screen reader? If so, then we could use your input on the development processes and tools you use while developing software.
