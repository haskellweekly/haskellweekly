Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Don't worry (about writing Haskell), be happy (writing Agda instead)!](https://jesper.sikanda.be/posts/agda2hs.html) by Jesper Cockx
  > As we all know, static type systems are great to ensure correctness of our programs. Sadly, in industry many people are forced to work in languages with a weak type system, such as Haskell.

- [Haskell and Visual Studio](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2022/10/3/haskell-and-visual-studio) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Most of the IDEs out there use graphical interfaces that let you use the mouse. Today we'll explore one of those options - Visual Studio (aka VS Code).

- [Introducing an effects system for Monocle](https://www.softwarefactory-project.io/introducing-an-effects-system-for-monocle.html) by Tristan de Cacqueray
  > This blog post explains the reasons we integrated an effect system in Monocle. This post aims to be beginner friendly. We understand that some concepts sound intimidating and we hope that this post demystifies them a bit.

- [Notes on Building "XcuseMe: Exercise tracking for real people"](https://www.unanswered.blog/xcuseme) by Willy Unterkoefler
  > IHP has been fantastic. The documentation is solid, it's easy to manage dependencies with Nix, I found a great tutorial on integrating with Elm, and deploying to IHP Cloud was a breeze (especially relative to the App Store).

- [Rewrite rule representation](https://jmtd.net/log/phd/representation/) by Jonathan Dowland
  > I've begun writing up my phd and, not for the first time, I'm pondering issues of how best to represent things. Specifically, rewrite rules.

- [Row Types in Haskell](http://blog.vmchale.com/article/row-types) by Vanessa McHale
  > "Typing Haskell in Haskell" makes the implementation of type systems concrete for programmers; recent developments in type theory have much to offer but are not developed to this depth even in theory.

## Jobs

- [Software Developer at Flipstone Technology Partners](https://jobs.gusto.com/postings/flipstone-technology-partners-inc-software-developer-067a5605-5dda-43a3-9159-cc4b2a8ec1c5) (ad)
  > Work as part of a client development team alongside another Flipstone developer to build and maintain backend systems in Haskell at a socially-forward Texas retailer. Pair-programming with Flipstone and client developers; mentor client developers to develop their engineering skills and knowledge.

## In brief

- [Beginner-friendly Haskell contributions](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/xst3o5/hacktoberfest_beginnerfriendly_haskell/) by Dmitrii Kovanikov
  > This year, I'm participating in Hacktoberfest as a mentor and maintainer.

- [Haskell Foundation August and September 2022 Update](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-august-and-september-2022-update/5116?u=taylorfausak) by David Thrane Christiansen
  > August and September were less busy than usual in the Haskell Foundation. I was on vacation for most of August, and September was spent attending ICFP, the Haskell Implementor's Workshop, and delivering a keynote address to the Haskell Symposium in Ljubljana.

- [Monthly Hask Anything (October 2022)](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/xslhig/monthly_hask_anything_october_2022/)
  > This is your opportunity to ask any questions you feel don't deserve their own threads, no matter how small or simple they might be!

## Show & tell

- [PL/Haskell v1.0 Released](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/plhaskell-v10-released-2519/) by Ed Behn
  > I'd like to announce the release of version 1.0 of the PL/Haskell extension. This extension allows users to write PostgreSQL functions in the Haskell functional programming language.

- [posit version 3.2](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/xu32du/ann_posit32/) by Nathan Waivio
  > Announcing the posit-3.2 library, where Real numbers are approximated by Maybe Rational. The Posit type is mapped to a 2's complement integer type; smoothly and with tapering precision, in a similar way to the projective real line.

- [Witch version 1.1.0.0](https://github.com/tfausak/witch/releases/tag/1.1.0.0) by Taylor Fausak
  > Removed instances with untagged UTF-8 conversions.
