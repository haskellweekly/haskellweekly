Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

<!-- Runs on 2021-06-10, 2021-06-24, 2021-07-08, and 2021-07-22. -->
- [What skills will give you an edge in 2022?](https://www.developereconomics.net/?utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=haskell&utm_campaign=haskell_newsletter) (ad)
  > Take the Developer Nation survey and share your views about the most important coding skills, tools, and platforms for 2022. You will get a virtual goody bag with free resources, plus a chance to win a new smartphone, a laptop, licenses, Amazon vouchers and more.

- [Breaking encapsulation in a controlled way using module signatures](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/breaking-encapsulation-in-a-controlled-way-using-module-signatures/2732?u=taylorfausak) by Daniel Díaz Carrete
  > Hi, I wanted to share this small experiment about using Backpack module signatures to manage encapsulation "levels" for abstract datatypes.

- [A Brief Introduction to Template Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-template-haskell) by Heitor Toledo Lassarote de Paula
  > In this article, we will explore some of the intricacies of Template Haskell and build a practical example that will introduce you to the metaprogramming capabilities of Haskell.

- [Function Application: Using the Dollar Sign ($)](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2021/7/5/function-application-using-the-dollar-sign-) by Monday Morning Haskell
  > Let's talk about one of the unsung heroes, a true foot soldier of the Haskell language: the function application operator, `($)`.

- [Past and Present of Haskell: Interview with Simon Peyton Jones](https://serokell.io/blog/past-and-present-of-haskell) by Jonn Mostovoy
  > In the interview, we discussed the past, present, and future of Haskell, Haskell's benefits and downsides, GHC, walking the line between Haskell being a research and industry language, and multiple other topics.

- [The timeout manager exception](https://magnus.therning.org/2021-07-03-the-timeout-manager-exception.html) by Magnus Therning
  > The other day I bumped the dependencies of a Haskell project at work and noticed a new exception being thrown: Thread killed by timeout manager.

- [Towards a Common Haskell Development Environment](https://chrisdornan.com/posts/2021-07-06-hs.html) by Chris Dornan
  > Clearly we want all Haskell installers like stack and ghcup to install both cabal-install and stack in such a way that they will use a toolchain that either installs, and ideally allows the developer to control which tool-chain installer gets invoked regardless of whether you are building with stack or cabal-install from a clean checkout.

## Jobs

<!-- Runs on 2021-07-08 and 2021-07-15. -->
- [Senior Software Developer at Flipstone](https://jobs.gusto.com/postings/flipstone-technology-partners-inc-senior-software-developer-bb5ad802-9429-4740-a48e-eea866881873) (ad)
  > Work as part of a client development team alongside another Flipstone developer to build and maintain backend systems in Haskell at a socially-forward Texas retailer. Pair-programming with Flipstone and client developers; mentor client developers to develop their engineering skills and knowledge.

<!-- Runs from 2021-07-08 to 2021-07-29. -->

## In brief

- [Haskell Foundation June Update](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/haskell-foundation-june-update/2722?u=taylorfausak) by Andrew Boardman

## Show & tell

- [StrongPath](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/oe7znw/code_review_request_strongpath_library_for/) by Martin Sosic
  > I just published (on Hackage) my first ever Haskell library, StrongPath, which provides a strongly typed representation of file paths, providing more safety during compile time than standard FilePath (well, String).

- [typeable-mock](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/oeyaz2/ann_typeablemock_mocks_that_can_fit_into_any/) by Boris Lykah
  > Its goal is to make mocking functions possible in the context of any monad and with as little boilerplate as possible.
