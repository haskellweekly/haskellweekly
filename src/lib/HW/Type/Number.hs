-- | This module defines a type for podcast episode or newsletter issue
-- numbers. Originally those were separate types, but it wasn't worth it to
-- differentiate between them. Although "number" sounds pretty general, it
-- might be better to think of this as an ID for a piece of content (episode or
-- issue) instead.
